M.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for most respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in infants and represents a significant economic burden for public health. The development of a safe, effective, and affordable vaccine is a priority for the WHO. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, escalating-dose phase 1 clinical trial in healthy males aged 18-50 years to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine expressing the nucleoprotein of RSV (rBCG-N-hRSV). Once inclusion criteria were met, volunteers were enrolled in three cohorts in an open and successive design. Each cohort included six volunteers vaccinated with 5Â Ã—Â 10(3), 5Â Ã—Â 10(4), or 1Â Ã—Â 10(5) CFU, as well as two volunteers vaccinated with the full dose of the standard BCG vaccine. This clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03213405) was conducted in Santiago, Chile. FINDINGS: The rBCG-N-RSV vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were recorded. Serum IgG-antibodies directed against Mycobacterium and the N-protein of RSV increased after vaccination, which were capable of neutralizing RSV in vitro. Additionally, all volunteers displayed increased cellular response consisting of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 production against PPD and the N-protein, starting at day 14 and 30 post-vaccination respectively. INTERPRETATION: The rBCG-N-hRSV vaccine had a good safety profile and induced specific cellular and humoral responses.

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial","Ascough, S.; Vlachantoni, I.; Kalyan, M.; Haijema, B. J.; Wallin-Weber, S.; Dijkstra-Tiekstra, M.; Ahmed, M. S.; van Roosmalen, M.; Grimaldi, R.; Zhang, Q.; Leenhouts, K.; Openshaw, P. J.; Chiu, C.","Rationale: Needle-free intranasal vaccines offer major potential advantages, especially against pathogens entering via mucosal surfaces. As yet, there is no effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a ubiquitous pathogen of global importance that preferentially infects respiratory epithelial cells; new strategies are urgently required.Objectives: Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a novel mucosal RSV F protein vaccine linked to an immunostimulatory bacterium-like particle (BLP).Methods: In this phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 48 healthy volunteers, aged 18-49 years, were randomly assigned to receive placebo or SynGEM (low or high dose) intranasally by prime-boost administration. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, with secondary objectives assessing virus-specific immunogenicity.Measurements and Main Results: There were no significant differences in adverse events between placebo and vaccinated groups. SynGEM induced systemic plasmablast responses and significant, durable increases in RSV-specific serum antibody in healthy, seropositive adults. Volunteers given low-dose SynGEM (140 Î¼g F, 2 mg BLP) required a boost at Day 28 to achieve plateau responses with a maximum fold change of 2.4, whereas high-dose recipients (350 Î¼g F, 5 mg BLP) achieved plateau responses with a fold change of 1.5 after first vaccination that remained elevated up to 180 days after vaccination, irrespective of further boosting. Palivizumab-like antibodies were consistently induced, but F protein site âˆ…-specific antibodies were not detected, and virus-specific nasal IgA responses were heterogeneous, with the strongest responses in individuals with lower pre-existing antibody levels.Conclusions: SynGEM is thus the first nonreplicating intranasal RSV subunit vaccine to induce persistent antibody responses in human volunteers.Clinical trials registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02958540).",2019,"Aug-15","Am J Respir Crit Care Med",200,"4","481-492",30753101,"10.1164/rccm.201810-1921OC",NA,"#66","Ascough 2019","Ainslie Hie (2024-11-26 13:51:30)(Included): extracted; ","Mucosis; NCT number; Possible RCT; general adults; immunogenicity; product not taken forward to phase 3; protein subunit;3_general_adults_immunogenicity",TRUE

C.; Gurtman, A.; Schmoele-Thoma, B.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are both typically seasonal diseases, with winter peaks in temperate climates. Coadministration of an RSV vaccine and influenza vaccine could be a benefit, requiring 1 rather than 2 visits to a healthcare provider for individuals receiving both vaccines. METHODS: The primary immunogenicity objective of this phase 3, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults aged â‰¥65 years in Australia was to demonstrate noninferiority of immune responses with coadministration of the stabilized RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) versus SIIV or RSVpreF administered alone, using a 1.5-fold noninferiority margin (lower bound 95% confidence interval >.667). Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collecting reactogenicity and adverse event data. RESULTS: Of 1403 participants randomized, 1399 received vaccinations (median age, 70; range, 65â€’91 years). Local reactions and systemic events were mostly mild or moderate when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV or administered alone. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Geometric mean ratios were 0.86 for RSV-A and 0.85 for RSV-B neutralizing titers at 1 month after RSVpreF administration and 0.77 to 0.90 for strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay titers at 1 month after SIIV. All comparisons achieved the prespecified 1.5-fold noninferiority margin. CONCLUSIONS: The primary study objectives were met, demonstrating noninferiority of RSVpreF and SIIV immune responses when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV and that RSVpreF had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when coadministered with SIIV. The results of this study support coadministration of RSVpreF and SIIV in an older-adult population.

F.","OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants. We are developing an RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine for immunization of third trimester pregnant women to passively protect infants through transfer of RSV-specific maternal antibodies. The present trial was performed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of several formulations of RSV F vaccine in 1-dose or 2-dose schedules. METHODS: Placebo, or vaccine with 60Î¼g or 120Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8mg aluminum, were administered intramuscularly on Days 0 and 28 to healthy women 18-35years old. Immunogenicity was assessed from Days 0 through 91 based on anti-F IgG and palivizumab-competitive antibody (PCA) by ELISA, and RSV A and B neutralizing antibodies by microneutralization (MN) assay. Solicited adverse events were collected through Day 7 and unsolicited adverse events through Day 91. RESULTS: All formulations were well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Anti-F IgG and PCA responses were correlated and increased after both doses, while MN increased significantly only after the first dose, then plateaued. The timeliest and most robust antibody responses followed one dose of 120Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.4mg aluminum, but persistence through 91days was modestly (âˆ¼25%) superior following two doses of 60Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.8mg aluminum. Western blot analysis showed RSV infections in active vaccinees were reduced by 52% overall (p=0.009 overall) over the Day 0 through 90 period. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F nanoparticle vaccine formulations were well tolerated and immunogenic. The optimal combination of convenience and rapid response for immunization in the third trimester occurred with 120Î¼g RSV F and 0.4mg aluminum, which achieved peak immune responses in 14days and sufficient persistence through 91days to allow for passive transfer of IgG antibodies to the fetus.

RESULTS: All RSVpreF vaccine candidates elicited robust and persistent serum neutralizing responses when administered alone or with SIIV. There was no notable difference in neutralizing response between the formulations, including those containing CpG. In the month 0,2 cohort, there was no booster effect of dose 2. SIIV responses were similar or slightly lower with concomitant administration of RSVpreF. Most systemic and local reactions were mild and more frequent after RSVpreF than placebo.

G.; Cooper, D.; Anderson, A. S.; Swanson, K. A.; Gruber, W. C.; Gurtman, A.","BACKGROUND: Bivalent RSV prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF), comprised of equal quantities of stabilized prefusion F antigens from the major circulating subgroups (RSV A, RSV B), is licensed for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in older adults and for maternal vaccination for prevention of RSV-associated LRTI in infants. To support licensure and large-scale manufacturing, this lot consistency study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence in immunogenicity across 3 RSVpreF lots. METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1:1:1), double-blind study evaluated immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of RSVpreF in healthy 18-49-year-old adults. Participants received a single 120-Âµg injection of 1 of 3RSVpreF lots or placebo. Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of RSV serum 50Â % neutralizing geometric mean titers obtained 1Â month after vaccination were compared between each vaccine lot for RSV A and RSV B, separately. Equivalence between lots was defined using a 1.5-fold criterion (GMR 95Â % CIs for every lot pair within the 0.667-1.5 interval). Safety and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Of 992participants vaccinated, 948 were included in the evaluable immunogenicity population. All 3 RSVpreF lots elicited strong immune responses, meeting the 1.5-fold equivalence criterion for all between-lot comparisons for both RSV A and RSV B. Across the 3 lots, RSV A and RSV B 50Â % neutralizing geometric mean titers substantially increased from baseline (RSV A, 1671-1795; RSV B 1358-1429) to 1Â month after RSVpreF vaccination (RSV A, 24,131-25,238; RSV B, 19,238-21,702), corresponding to â‰¥14-fold increases in 50Â % neutralizing titers for both RSV A and RSV B from before to 1Â month after vaccination. Single doses of RSVpreF were safe and well tolerated, with similar safety profiles across the 3 RSVpreF lots.

N.; Henry, O.","BACKGROUND: In a phase 1/2 study, a maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate (RSVPreF3) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and efficiently increased RSV-specific humoral immune responses in non-pregnant women. METHODS: In this phase 2 observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (NCT04126213), the safety of RSVPreF3 (60 or 120 Âµg), administered during late second or third trimester, was evaluated in 213 18- to 40-year-old healthy pregnant women through 6 months postdelivery and their offspring through infancy; immunogenicity was evaluated through day 43 postdelivery and day 181 postbirth, respectively. RESULTS: RSVPreF3 was well tolerated. No pregnancy-related or neonatal adverse events of special interest were considered vaccine/placebo related. In the 60 and 120 Âµg RSVPreF3 groups: (1) neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers in mothers increased 12.7- and 14.9-fold against RSV-A and 10.6- and 13.2-fold against RSV-B, respectively, 1 month postvaccination and remained 8.9-10.0-fold over prevaccination at day 43 postdelivery; (2) nAb titers were consistently higher compared to placebo recipients; (3) placental transfer ratios for anti-RSVPreF3 antibodies at birth were 1.62 and 1.90, respectively, and (4) nAb levels in infants were highest at birth and declined through day 181 postbirth. CONCLUSIONS: RSVPreF3 maternal vaccination had an acceptable safety risk profile and induced robust RSV-specific immune responses with successful antibody transfer to their newborns. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04126213.
WHAT IS THE CONTEXT? Infants, especially those less than 6 months of age, are at increased risk of lung infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, this risk could be reduced with maternal vaccination against RSV during pregnancy. A previous clinical trial found that a vaccine candidate (named RSVPreF3) was well tolerated when given to non-pregnant women. WHAT IS NEW? In pregnant women, RSVPreF3 was also well tolerated. Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events was similar between vaccine and placebo recipients. None of the serious adverse events or events of interest for pregnant women or newborns were considered related to the study intervention. One month after vaccination, mothers who received RSVPreF3 had 11â€“15 times higher levels of antibodies against RSV than before vaccination. These antibody levels remained similar until 43 days after delivery. In the infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with RSVPreF3, antibody levels were highest at birth, when levels were higher than in their mothers, and declined through day 181 postbirth. WHAT IS THE IMPACT? RSVPreF3 had an acceptable safety risk profile in pregnant women and their babies. This vaccine induced potent immune responses against RSV, with maternal antibodies transferred to infants of the vaccinated mothers.

RSV vaccination during pregnancy could boost preexisting neutralizing antibody titers, providing passive protection to newborns. METHODS: Two observer-blinded, controlled studies (RSV F-020 [clinical trials registration NCT02360475] and RSV F-024 [NCT02753413]) evaluated immunogenicity and safety of an investigational RSV vaccine in healthy, nonpregnant 18-45-year-old women. Both studies used a licensed adult formulation of combined tetanus toxoid-diphtheria toxoid-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine as a control. RSV F-020 evaluated immunogenicity and safety: participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive 1 dose of RSV-prefusion F protein (PreF) vaccine containing 30 Âµg or 60 Âµg of nonadjuvanted RSV-PreF, 60 Âµg of aluminum-adjuvanted RSV-PreF, or Tdap. RSV F-024 evaluated safety: participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of 60 Âµg of nonadjuvanted RSV-PreF or Tdap. RESULTS: Both studies showed similar reactogenicity profiles for RSV-PreF and Tdap. No serious adverse events were considered vaccine related. In RSV F-020, geometric mean ratios of RSV-A neutralizing antibody levels at day 30 versus prevaccination were 3.1-3.9 in RSV-PreF recipients and 0.9 in controls.

A.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory illness in young children and lacks a vaccine. RSV cold-passage/stabilized 2 (RSVcps2) is a modification of a previously evaluated vaccine candidate in which 2 major attenuating mutations have been stabilized against deattenuation. METHODS: RSV-seronegative 6-24-month-old children received an intranasal dose of 105.3 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSVcps2 (n = 34) or placebo (n = 16) (International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials protocol P1114 and companion protocol CIR285). RSV serum neutralizing antibody titers before and 56 days after vaccination, vaccine virus infectivity (defined as vaccine virus shedding detectable in nasal wash and/or a â‰¥4-fold rise in serum antibodies), reactogenicity, and genetic stability were assessed. During the following RSV transmission season, participants were monitored for respiratory illness, with serum antibody titers measured before and after the season. RESULTS: A total of 85% of vaccinees were infected with RSVcps2 (median peak titer, 0.5 log10 PFU/mL by culture and 2.9 log10 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction analysis); 77% shed vaccine virus, and 59% developed a â‰¥4-fold rise in RSV-serum neutralizing antibody titers.

In this phase 3, open-label, randomized study, we evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) when co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLU-QIV) in older adults. METHODS: Participants aged â‰¥60 years (randomized 1:1) received either RSVPreF3 OA and FLU-QIV simultaneously on day 1 (Co-Ad group) or FLU-QIV on day 1 followed by RSVPreF3 OA on day 31 (sequential administration [SA] group). The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of RSVPreF3 OA in terms of RSV-A neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and FLU-QIV in terms of hemagglutination inhibition GMT ratio for each FLU-QIV strain, when co-administered versus when administered alone at 1-month post-vaccination. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interview of the group GMT ratio (SA/Co-Ad) was â‰¤1.5. Secondary descriptive objectives comprised additional immunogenicity assessments, reactogenicity, and safety. RESULTS: Of the 885 participants who received one dose of the study vaccines, 837 were included in the per protocol set. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. Both co-primary objectives were met for both vaccines. Reported adverse events in both groups were mild-to-moderate, with a low frequency of grade 3 events.

This Phase I, randomized, observer-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluated an investigational vaccine against RSV (ChAd155-RSV) using the viral vector chimpanzee-adenovirus-155, encoding RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid, and transcription antitermination proteins. METHODS: Healthy 18-45-year-old adults received ChAd155-RSV, a placebo, or an active control (Bexsero) at Days (D) 0 and 30. An escalation from a low dose (5 Ã— 109 viral particles) to a high dose (5 Ã— 1010 viral particles) occurred after the first 16 participants. Endpoints were solicited/unsolicited and serious adverse events (SAEs), biochemical/hematological parameters, cell-mediated immunogenicity by enzyme-linked immunospot, functional neutralizing antibodies, anti RSV-F immunoglobin (Ig) G, and ChAd155 neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: There were 7 participants who received the ChAd155-RSV low dose, 31 who received the ChAd155-RSV high dose, 19 who received the placebo, and 15 who received the active control. No dose-related toxicity or attributable SAEs at the 1-year follow-up were observed. The RSV-A neutralizing antibodies geometric mean titer ratios (post/pre-immunization) following a high dose were 2.6 (D30) and 2.3 (D60). The ratio of the fold-rise (D0 to D30) in anti-F IgG over the fold-rise in RSV-A-neutralizing antibodies was 1.01. At D7 after the high dose of the study vaccine, the median frequencies of circulating B-cells secreting anti-F antibodies were 133.3/106 (IgG) and 16.7/106 (IgA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The median frequency of RSV-F-specific interferon Î³-secreting T-cells after a ChAd155-RSV high dose was 108.3/106 PBMCs at D30, with no increase after the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: In adults previously naturally exposed to RSV, ChAd155-RSV generated increases in specific humoral and cellular immune responses without raising significant safety concerns.

R.; Klyashtornyy, V.; De Paepe, E.; Omoruyi, E.; van der Fits, L.; van Heesbeen, R.; Heijnen, E.; Callendret, B.; Sadoff, J.","BACKGROUND: Ad26.RSV.preF is an adenovirus serotype 26 vector-based respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine encoding a prefusion conformation-stabilized RSV fusion protein (preF) that demonstrated robust humoral and cellular immunogenicity and showed promising efficacy in a human challenge study in younger adults. Addition of recombinant RSV preF protein might enhance RSV-specific humoral immune responses, especially in older populations. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a study compared the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.preF alone and varying doses of Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein combinations in adults aged â‰¥60 years. This report includes data from cohort 1 (initial safety, n = 64) and cohort 2 (regimen selection, n = 288). Primary immunogenicity and safety analyses were performed 28 days postvaccination (cohort 2) for regimen selection. RESULTS: All vaccine regimens were well tolerated, with similar reactogenicity profiles among them. Combination regimens induced greater humoral immune responses (virus-neutralizing and preF-specific binding antibodies) and similar cellular ones (RSV-F-specific T cells) as compared with Ad26.RSV.preF alone. Vaccine-induced immune responses remained above baseline up to 1.5 years postvaccination. CONCLUSIONS: All Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimens were well tolerated. A combination regimen comprising Ad26.RSV.preF, which elicits strong humoral and cellular responses, and RSV preF protein, which increases humoral responses, was selected for further development.

K.; Webster, P.; Dormitzer, P. R.","BACKGROUND: Vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during pregnancy may protect infants from RSV disease. Efficacy and safety data on a candidate RSV prefusion F protein-based maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3-Mat) are needed. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 trial involving pregnant women 18 to 49 years of age to assess the efficacy and safety of RSVPreF3-Mat. The women were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive RSVPreF3-Mat or placebo between 24 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 0 days of gestation. The primary outcomes were any or severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants from birth to 6 months of age and safety in infants from birth to 12 months of age. After the observation of a higher risk of preterm birth in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, enrollment and vaccination were stopped early, and exploratory analyses of the safety signal of preterm birth were performed. RESULTS: The analyses included 5328 pregnant women and 5233 infants; the target enrollment of approximately 10,000 pregnant women and their infants was not reached because enrollment was stopped early. A total of 3426 infants in the vaccine group and 1711 infants in the placebo group were followed from birth to 6 months of age; 16 and 24 infants, respectively, had any medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 65.5%; 95% credible interval, 37.5 to 82.0), and 8 and 14, respectively, had severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 69.0%; 95% credible interval, 33.0 to 87.6). Preterm birth occurred in 6.8% of the infants (237 of 3494) in the vaccine group and in 4.9% of those (86 of 1739) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.74; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01); neonatal death occurred in 0.4% (13 of 3494) and 0.2% (3 of 1739), respectively (relative risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 0.62 to 7.56; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.23), an imbalance probably attributable to the greater percentage of preterm births in the vaccine group. No other safety signal was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, in which enrollment was stopped early because of safety concerns, suggest that the risks of any and severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease among infants were lower with the candidate maternal RSV vaccine than with placebo but that the risk of preterm birth was higher with the candidate vaccine.

This was a phase I/II trial (NCT02927873) of ChAd155-RSV, an investigational chimpanzee adenovirus-RSV vaccine expressing 3 proteins (fusion, nucleoprotein, and M2-1), administered to 12-23-month-old RSV-seropositive children followed up for 2 years after vaccination. METHODS: Children were randomized to receive 2 doses of ChAd155-RSV or placebo (at a 1:1 ratio) (days 1 and 31). Doses escalated from 0.5 Ã— 1010 (low dose [LD]) to 1.5 Ã— 1010 (medium dose [MD]) to 5 Ã— 1010 (high dose [HD]) viral particles after safety assessment. Study end points included anti-RSV-A neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers through year 1 and safety through year 2. RESULTS: Eighty-two participants were vaccinated, including 11, 14, and 18 in the RSV-LD, RSV-MD, and RSV-HD groups, respectively, and 39 in the placebo groups. Solicited adverse events were similar across groups, except for fever (more frequent with RSV-HD). Most fevers were mild (â‰¤38.5Â°C). No vaccine-related serious adverse events or RSV-related hospitalizations were reported. There was a dose-dependent increase in RSV-A Nab titers in all groups after dose 1, without further increase after dose 2. RSV-A Nab titers remained higher than prevaccination levels at year 1. CONCLUSIONS: Three ChAd155-RSV dosages were found to be well tolerated. A dose-dependent immune response was observed after dose 1, with no observed booster effect after dose 2. Further investigation of ChAd155-RSV in RSV-seronegative children is warranted. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02927873.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the main causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia regularly leading to hospitalization in children. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent RSV infection in this age group has not yet been found, despite great efforts over several decades. This study tested a new candidate RSV vaccine, expressing 3 important pieces of the virus, in toddlers who already had a previous RSV infection. The vaccine was generally well tolerated. Vaccination triggered antibodies against RSV that were able to block the virus in laboratory tests and that persisted for 1 year.

N.","BACKGROUND: The safety of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and the effect of nirsevimab on hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection when administered in healthy infants are unclear. METHODS: In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, infants who were 12 months of age or younger, had been born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, and were entering their first RSV season in France, Germany, or the United Kingdom to receive either a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or standard care (no intervention) before or during the RSV season. The primary end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospital admission and an RSV-positive test result. A key secondary end point was very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% and the need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 8058 infants were randomly assigned to receive nirsevimab (4037 infants) or standard care (4021 infants). Eleven infants (0.3%) in the nirsevimab group and 60 (1.5%) in the standard-care group were hospitalized for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, which corresponded to a nirsevimab efficacy of 83.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.8 to 92.0; P<0.001). Very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 5 infants (0.1%) in the nirsevimab group and in 19 (0.5%) in the standard-care group, which represented a nirsevimab efficacy of 75.7% (95% CI, 32.8 to 92.9; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). The efficacy of nirsevimab against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 89.6% (adjusted 95% CI, 58.8 to 98.7; multiplicity-adjusted P<0.001) in France, 74.2% (adjusted 95% CI, 27.9 to 92.5; multiplicity-adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) in Germany, and 83.4% (adjusted 95% CI, 34.3 to 97.6; multiplicity-adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) in the United Kingdom.

METHODS: CYPRESS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study done at 40 US clinical research centres wherein adults aged 65 years or older were centrally randomly assigned 1:1 by computer algorithm to receive Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein or placebo (one intramuscular injection) on day 1. Investigators, participants, site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to vaccine allocation, except for individuals involved in preparation of study vaccinations. The primary endpoint (first occurrence of RSV-mediated LRTD meeting one of three case definitions) was previously reported. Here, the predefined exploratory endpoint of vaccine efficacy against RSV-positive LRTD was assessed in the per-protocol efficacy set (all participants randomly assigned and vaccinated without protocol deviations affecting efficacy) through season 1 and from day 365 until the end of season 3. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of randomly assigned and vaccinated participants. The secondary endpoint of safety through the first RSV season was previously reported; follow-up for selected safety outcomes (fatal adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation, serious adverse events, and vaccine-related serious adverse events) until study completion is reported here in all randomly assigned and vaccinated participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03982199 and is complete. FINDINGS: Of 6672 adults screened, 5782 participants (2891 each receiving vaccine or placebo) were enrolled and vaccinated between Aug 5 and Nov 13, 2019. The season 2 per-protocol efficacy set included 2124 vaccine recipients and 2126 placebo recipients (season 3: 864 and 881; across three seasons: 2795 and 2803, respectively).

A.; Jiang, Q.; Gomme, E.; Cooper, D.; Schmoele-Thoma, B.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults and adults with comorbidities. An effective vaccine is needed. An investigational bivalent prefusion F vaccine (RSVpreF) was assessed in healthy adults. METHODS: This phase 1/2 study randomized adults 18-85 years old to receive placebo or 60, 120, or 240 Âµg RSVpreF (with or without aluminum hydroxide) alone or concomitantly with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed. RESULTS: In older adults, reactogenicity events were predominantly mild or moderate among RSVpreF recipients; adverse events through 1 month postvaccination were similar across formulations. Coadministration with SIIV did not appear to affect safety among younger or older adults. All RSVpreF formulations with or without concomitant SIIV elicited robust RSV serum-neutralizing responses in adults aged 50-85 years 1 month postvaccination.

An adenovirus serotype 26 RSV vector encoding a prefusion F (preF) protein (Ad26.RSV.preF) in combination with RSV preF protein was previously shown to elicit humoral and cellular immunogenicity. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b, proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein vaccine. Adults who were 65 years of age or older were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vaccine or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of RSV-mediated lower respiratory tract disease that met one of three case definitions: three or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (definition 1), two or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (definition 2), and either two or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection or one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection plus at least one systemic symptom (definition 3). RESULTS: Overall, 5782 participants were enrolled and received an injection. RSV-mediated lower respiratory tract disease meeting case definitions 1, 2, and 3 occurred in 6, 10, and 13 vaccine recipients and in 30, 40, and 43 placebo recipients, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was 80.0% (94.2% confidence interval [CI], 52.2 to 92.9), 75.0% (94.2% CI, 50.1 to 88.5), and 69.8% (94.2% CI, 43.7 to 84.7) for case definitions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After vaccination, RSV A2 neutralizing antibody titers increased by a factor of 12.1 from baseline to day 15, a finding consistent with other immunogenicity measures. Percentages of participants with solicited local and systemic adverse events were higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (local, 37.9% vs. 8.4%; systemic, 41.4% vs. 16.4%); most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the vaccine group and the placebo group (4.6% and 4.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults 65 years of age or older, Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein vaccine was immunogenic and prevented RSV-mediated lower respiratory tract disease.

In an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicountry, phase 3 trial in â‰¥60-year-old participants, an AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) was efficacious against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD), severe RSV-LRTD, and RSV-ARI. We evaluated efficacy and immunogenicity among participants with coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV disease (""conditions of interest""). METHODS: Medically stable â‰¥60-year-old participants received 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. Efficacy against first RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI episodes was assessed in subgroups with/without coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions of interest.

Serum RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration was assessed at baseline and 30Â days post-vaccination. Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated if the two-sided 95Â % confidence intervals (CIs) of the RSVPreF3-binding IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios between each lot pair at 30Â days post-vaccination were within 0.67 and 1.50. Solicited adverse events (AEs) within four days, unsolicited AEs within 30Â days, and serious AEs (SAEs) and potential immune-mediated diseases within six months post-vaccination were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 757 participants received RSVPreF3 OA, of whom 708 were included in the per-protocol set (234, 237, and 237 participants for each lot). Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated: GMC ratios were 1.06 (95Â % CI: 0.94-1.21), 0.92 (0.81-1.04), and 0.87 (0.77-0.99) between the lot pairs (lot 1/2; 1/3; 2/3).

M.","BACKGROUND: A preventative strategy for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection constitutes an under-recognized unmet medical need among older adults. Four formulations of a novel recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90Â Î¼g RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) administered concurrently with a licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in older adult subjects were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in this randomized, observer-blinded study. RESULTS: A total of 220 healthy males and femalesâ€‰â‰¥â€‰60Â years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, were vaccinated concurrently with TIV and RSV F vaccine or placebo. All vaccine formulations produced an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or evidence of systemic toxicity. Vaccine-induced immune responses were rapid, rising as early as 7Â days post-vaccination; and were comparable in all formulations in terms of magnitude, with maximal levels attained within 28 (unadjuvanted) or 56 (adjuvanted) days post-vaccination. Peak anti-F protein IgG antibody levels rose 3.6- to 5.6-fold, with an adjuvant effect observed at the 60Â Î¼g dose, and a dose-effect observed between the unadjuvanted 60 and 90Â Î¼g regimens. The anti-F response persisted through 12Â months post-vaccination. Palivizumab-competitive antibodies were below quantifiable levels (<33Â Î¼g/mL) at day 0. The rise of antibodies with specificity for Site II peptide, and the palivizumab-competitive binding activity, denoting antibodies binding at, or in proximity to, antigenic Site II on the F protein, closely paralleled the anti-F response. However, a larger proportion of antibodies in adjuvanted vaccine recipients bound to the Site II peptide at high avidity. Day 0 neutralizing antibodies were high in all subjects and rose 1.3- to 1.7-fold in response to vaccination. Importantly, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with TIV did not impact the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not impact the immune response to the RSV F vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccine induced increases in measures of functional immunity to RSV in older adults and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.

K.; Villafana, T.; Dubovsky, F.","Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness in infants is a major public health priority, but there is no approved vaccine. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that provides RSV prophylaxis but requires 5 monthly injections and is approved only for infants who experience the greatest morbidity and mortality from RSV. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for prevention of RSV disease in healthy infants. MEDI8897 is a recombinant human RSV monoclonal antibody with a modified Fc region that extends its half-life and is being developed as RSV prophylaxis for all infants. In this phase 1, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study, 136 healthy adults were randomized to receive a single dose of MEDI8897 (n = 102) or placebo (n = 34) in 1 of 5 cohorts (300, 1,000, or 3,000 mg intravenously or 100 or 300 mg intramuscularly [i.m.]) and were monitored for 360 days. The mean half-life of MEDI8897 was 85 to 117 days across dose groups, and bioavailability after 300-mg i.m. dose administration was 77%.

Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody to the RSV fusion protein that has an extended half-life. The efficacy and safety of nirsevimab in healthy late-preterm and term infants are uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, infants who had been born at a gestational age of at least 35 weeks to receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo before the start of an RSV season. The primary efficacy end point was medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. The secondary efficacy end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. RESULTS: A total of 1490 infants underwent randomization: 994 were assigned to the nirsevimab group and 496 to the placebo group. Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 12 infants (1.2%) in the nirsevimab group and in 25 infants (5.0%) in the placebo group; these findings correspond to an efficacy of 74.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6 to 87.1; P<0.001) for nirsevimab. Hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 6 infants (0.6%) in the nirsevimab group and in 8 infants (1.6%) in the placebo group (efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, -8.6 to 86.8; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07).

RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomized (1:1) to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV_revaccination group) or placebo (RSV_1dose group) pre-season 2; participants who received placebo pre-season 1 received placebo pre-season 2 (placebo group). Efficacy of both vaccine regimens against RSV-LRTD was evaluated over 2 seasons combined (confirmatory secondary objective, success criterion: lower limits of 2-sided confidence intervals [CIs] around efficacy estimates >20%). RESULTS: The efficacy analysis comprised 24,967 participants (RSV_1dose: 6227, RSV_revaccination: 6242, placebo: 12,498). Median efficacy follow-up was 17.8 months. Efficacy over 2 seasons of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose was 67.2% (97.5% CI: 48.2-80.0) against RSV-LRTD and 78.8% (95% CI: 52.6-92.0) against severe RSV-LRTD. Efficacy over 2 seasons of a first dose followed by revaccination was 67.1% (97.5% CI: 48.1-80.0) against RSV-LRTD and 78.8% (95% CI: 52.5-92.0) against severe RSV-LRTD. Reactogenicity/safety of the revaccination dose were similar to dose 1. CONCLUSION: One RSVPreF3 OA dose was efficacious against RSV-LRTD over 2 RSV seasons in â‰¥60-year-olds. Revaccination 1 year post-dose 1 was well tolerated but did not seem to provide additional efficacy benefit in the overall study population.

A.; Weidenthaler, H.; Stroukova, D.; Martin, B. K.; De Moerlooze, L.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant disease burden in older adults. MVA-BN-RSV is a novel poxvirus-vectored vaccine encoding internal and external RSV proteins. METHODS: In a phase 2a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy participants aged 18 to 50 years received MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, then were challenged 4 weeks later with RSV-A Memphis 37b. Viral load was assessed from nasal washes. RSV symptoms were collected. Antibody titers and cellular markers were assessed before and after vaccination and challenge. RESULTS: After receiving MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, 31 and 32 participants, respectively, were challenged. Viral load areas under the curve from nasal washes were lower (P = .017) for MVA-BN-RSV (median = 0.00) than placebo (median = 49.05). Total symptom scores also were lower (median = 2.50 and 27.00, respectively; P = .004). Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed or culture-confirmed infection was 79.3% to 88.5% (P = .022 and .013). Serum immunoglobulin A and G titers increased approximately 4-fold after MVA-BN-RSV vaccination. Interferon-Î³-producing cells increased 4- to 6-fold after MVA-BN-RSV in response to stimulation with the encoded RSV internal antigens. Injection site pain occurred more frequently with MVA-BN-RSV. No serious adverse events were attributed to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: MVA-BN-RSV vaccination resulted in lower viral load and symptom scores, fewer confirmed infections, and induced humoral and cellular responses.

Protective immunity is not generated after repeated infections, but vaccination may hopefully prove effective. METHODS: This phase 2 clinical study investigated a multivalent RSV vaccine (MVA-BN-RSV) designed to induce broad antibody and cellular immune responses by encoding RSV surface proteins F, G (for both A and B subtypes), and internal antigens (M2, N). This study evaluated the immune response in adults aged â‰¥55 years to identify the optimal MVA-BN-RSV dose and vaccination schedule. RESULTS: A single dose increased the levels of neutralizing (plaque reduction neutralization test to RSV A and B) and total (IgG and IgA ELISA) antibodies (1.6 to 3.4-fold increase from baseline) and induced a broad Th1-biased cellular immune response (interferon-Î³ ELISPOT) to all 5 vaccine inserts (5.4 to 9.7-fold increases). Antibody responses remained above baseline for 6 months. A 12-month booster dose elicited a booster effect in antibody and T-cell responses (up to 2.8-fold from preboost levels). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: MVA-BN-RSV induces a broad immune response that persists at least 6 months and can be boosted at 12 months, without significant safety findings.

METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind trial conducted in 18 countries, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, pregnant women at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation to receive a single intramuscular injection of 120 Î¼g of a bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine or placebo. The two primary efficacy end points were medically attended severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants within 90, 120, 150, and 180 days after birth. A lower boundary of the confidence interval for vaccine efficacy (99.5% confidence interval [CI] at 90 days; 97.58% CI at later intervals) greater than 20% was considered to meet the success criterion for vaccine efficacy with respect to the primary end points. RESULTS: At this prespecified interim analysis, the success criterion for vaccine efficacy was met with respect to one primary end point. Overall, 3682 maternal participants received vaccine and 3676 received placebo; 3570 and 3558 infants, respectively, were evaluated. Medically attended severe lower respiratory tract illness occurred within 90 days after birth in 6 infants of women in the vaccine group and 33 infants of women in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 81.8%; 99.5% CI, 40.6 to 96.3); 19 cases and 62 cases, respectively, occurred within 180 days after birth (vaccine efficacy, 69.4%; 97.58% CI, 44.3 to 84.1). Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness occurred within 90 days after birth in 24 infants of women in the vaccine group and 56 infants of women in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 57.1%; 99.5% CI, 14.7 to 79.8); these results did not meet the statistical success criterion. No safety signals were detected in maternal participants or in infants and toddlers up to 24 months of age. The incidences of adverse events reported within 1 month after injection or within 1 month after birth were similar in the vaccine group (13.8% of women and 37.1% of infants) and the placebo group (13.1% and 34.5%, respectively).

RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L contains 2 attenuating elements: (1) deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and (2) deletion of codon 1313 of the RSV polymerase gene and the stabilizing missense mutation I1314L. This live vaccine candidate was temperature-sensitive, genetically stable, replication restricted, and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine-placebo ratio, 2:1) at 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive children and at 105 and 106 PFU in 21 and 30 RSV-seronegative children, respectively. RESULTS: In RSV-seronegative children, the 105 PFU dose was overattenuated, but the 106 PFU dose was well tolerated, infectious (RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L replication detected in 90% of vaccinees), and immunogenic (geometric mean serum RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer, 1:64). After the RSV season, 9 of 20 vaccinees had increases in the RSV titer that were significantly greater than those in 8 of 10 placebo recipients (1:955 vs 1:69, respectively), indicating that the vaccine primed for anamnestic responses after natural RSV exposure.

RSV MEDI Î”M2-2 was therefore evaluated as a live intranasal vaccine in adults, RSV-seropositive children, and RSV-seronegative children. When results in RSV-seronegative children were compared to those achieved with the previous leading live attenuated RSV candidate vaccine, vaccine virus shedding was significantly more restricted, yet the postvaccination RSV-neutralizing serum antibody achieved [geometric mean titer (GMT) = 1:97] was significantly greater.

V.; De Schrevel, N.; Salaun, B.; Verheust, C.; David, M. P.; Kotb, S.; HulstrÃ¸m, V.","BACKGROUND: In the previous (parent) study, 2 doses of different formulations of an investigational vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSVPreF3 OA) were well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults. This multicenter phase 2b extension study assessed safety and immunogenicity of a revaccination (third) dose of the 120 Î¼g RSVPreF3-AS01E formulation. METHODS: In total, 122 older adults (60-80 years), previously vaccinated with 2 doses of RSVPreF3-AS01E formulations (containing 30, 60, or 120 Î¼g RSVPreF3 antigen), received an additional 120 Î¼g RSVPreF3-AS01E dose 18 months after dose 2. Vaccine safety was evaluated in all participants up to 6 months and immunogenicity in participants who received 120 Î¼g RSVPreF3-AS01E doses until 1 month after dose 3. RESULTS: Similar to the parent study, mostly mild-to-moderate solicited adverse events and no vaccine-related serious adverse events or potential immune-mediated disorders were reported. Neutralizing titers and cell-mediated immune responses persisted for 18 months after 2-dose vaccination. Dose 3 increased RSV-specific neutralizing titers against RSV-A and RSV-B and median CD4+ T-cell frequencies. After dose 3, RSV-specific neutralizing titers but not CD4+ T-cell frequencies were below levels detected 1 month after dose 1. CONCLUSIONS: Revaccination with 120 Î¼g RSVPreF3-AS01E 18 months after dose 2 is well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04657198; EudraCT, 2020-000692-21.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious seasonal virus causing respiratory tract infections. In older adults, RSV can cause serious respiratory illnesses or worsen underlying medical conditions such as chronic diseases of the lungs or heart failure. Severe disease may lead to hospitalization, increased need for oxygen, and ventilatory support. However, several vaccines against RSV in older adults have recently been licensed in the United States and European Union. This study evaluated safety and immune responses after revaccination (third dose) with an adjuvanted vaccine against RSV in older adults aged 60â€“80 years, who had received 2 doses of the vaccine with a similar adjuvanted formulation in a previous (parent) study. Revaccination was done with the licensed vaccine formulation, which was also selected for further investigation in several phase 3 clinical trials. This study found that immune responses against RSV persisted above prevaccination levels for at least 18 months after the second vaccination in the parent study. The third vaccine dose was well tolerated and recalled the immune responses in older adults. Together with the ongoing confirmatory clinical trials, these results help better characterize this RSV vaccine, in terms of safety and RSV-specific immune responses elicited in older adults.

F.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the dominant cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, with the most severe cases concentrated among younger infants. METHODS: Healthy pregnant women, at 28 weeks 0 days through 36 weeks 0 days of gestation, with an expected delivery date near the start of the RSV season, were randomly assigned in an overall ratio of approximately 2:1 to receive a single intramuscular dose of RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine or placebo. Infants were followed for 180 days to assess outcomes related to lower respiratory tract infection and for 364 days to assess safety. The primary end point was RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection up to 90 days of life, and the primary analysis of vaccine efficacy against the primary end point was performed in the per-protocol population of infants (prespecified criterion for success, lower bound of the 97.52% confidence interval [CI] of â‰¥30%). RESULTS: A total of 4636 women underwent randomization, and there were 4579 live births. During the first 90 days of life, the percentage of infants with RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection was 1.5% in the vaccine group and 2.4% in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 39.4%; 97.52% CI, -1.0 to 63.7; 95% CI, 5.3 to 61.2). The corresponding percentages for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with severe hypoxemia were 0.5% and 1.0% (vaccine efficacy, 48.3%; 95% CI, -8.2 to 75.3), and the percentages for hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection were 2.1% and 3.7% (vaccine efficacy, 44.4%; 95% CI, 19.6 to 61.5). Local injection-site reactions among the women were more common with vaccine than with placebo (40.7% vs. 9.9%), but the percentages of participants who had other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccination in pregnant women did not meet the prespecified success criterion for efficacy against RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to 90 days of life. The suggestion of a possible benefit with respect to other end-point events involving RSV-associated respiratory disease in infants warrants further study.

S.; Dubovsky, F.","Despite substantial morbidity associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, there is no licensed vaccine. MEDI-559 is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine candidate being developed for prevention of lower respiratory illness due to RSV in young children. This randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated safety of MEDI-559 in healthy, RSV-seronegative children. MEDI-559 or placebo was administered on 3 occasions, 2 months apart. Primary safety was based on solicited symptoms (SSs) and adverse events (AEs) collected for 28 days after each dose. Nasal wash samples were collected 3 times after each dose (days 7-10, 12-18, 28-34) and at sick visits. Serum was collected for measuring antibody immune responses to RSV prior to first vaccination and 28 days post final dose. Long-term safety was monitored for 365 days from first dose. SSs were mild and frequent (MEDI-559 84%; placebo 91%); most common SSs were runny/stuffy nose, cough, and irritability/fussiness. AEs occurred in 67% MEDI-559 and 57% placebo recipients: most common AE was upper respiratory tract infection (MEDI-559 35%; placebo 23%). Higher incidence of medically attended lower respiratory illness within 28 days after dosing occurred in the MEDI-559 arm compared to placebo (none associated with vaccine virus shedding). There was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease. Vaccine virus was detected only in MEDI-559 recipients; shedding occurred in 56%subjects, primarily post dose 1. A functional immune response was observed in 59% and 9% MEDI-559 and placebo recipients, respectively, by an RSV microneutralization assay. Vaccine take, assessed by proportion that shed vaccine-type virus or had a seroresponse against RSV, was seen in 95% MEDI-559 subjects. MEDI-559 is therefore biologically active and immunogenic in this seronegative pediatric population. Although the frequency of SSs and AEs was not considered clinically significant, the increase in medically attended lower respiratory illnesses in the vaccine group warrants expanded safety studies.

There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection. METHODS: In an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01(E)-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to show vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI], 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 62.4 to 99.9) against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (assessed on the basis of clinical signs or by the investigator) and 71.7% (95% CI, 56.2 to 82.3) against RSV-related acute respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy was similar against the RSV A and B subtypes (for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease: 84.6% and 80.9%, respectively; for RSV-related acute respiratory infection: 71.9% and 70.6%, respectively). High vaccine efficacy was observed in various age groups and in participants with coexisting conditions. The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but most adverse events for which reports were solicited were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. The incidences of serious adverse events and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar in the two groups.

The primary objectives evaluated the safety and tolerability at every dose within 28 days following each injection. Neutralising activity and RSV F-binding antibodies were evaluated from week 0 to week 44 as secondary and exploratory objectives. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose; secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analysis included all participants with available data at a given visit. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049488, and is complete and no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Feb 21, 2017, and Nov 29, 2018, 244 participants were screened for eligibility and 95 were enrolled to receive DS-Cav1 at the 50 Î¼g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH), 150 Î¼g (n=35, of which n=15 with AlOH), or 500 Î¼g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH) doses. DS-Cav1 was safe and well tolerated and no serious vaccine-associated adverse events deemed related to the vaccine were identified. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited robust neutralising activity and binding antibodies by 4 weeks after a single vaccination (p<0Â·0001 for F-binding and neutralising antibodies). In analyses of exploratory endpoints at week 44, pre-F-binding IgG and neutralising activity were significantly increased compared with baseline in all groups. At week 44, RSV A neutralising activity was 3Â·1 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·8 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·5 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). RSV B neutralising activity was 2Â·8 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·4 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 3Â·7 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Pre-F-binding IgG remained significantly 3Â·2 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·4 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·0 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Pre-F-binding serum IgA remained 4Â·1 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 4Â·3 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·8 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Although a higher vaccine dose or second immunisation elicited a transient advantage compared with lower doses or a single immunisation, neither significantly impacted long-term neutralisation. There was no long-term effect of dose, number of vaccinations, or adjuvant on neutralising activity. INTERPRETATION: In this phase 1 study, DS-Cav1 vaccination was safe and well tolerated. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited a robust boost in RSV F-specific antibodies and neutralising activity that was sustained above baseline for at least 44 weeks. A single low-dose of pre-F immunisation of antigen-experienced individuals might confer protection that extends throughout an entire RSV season.

This study assessed the potential of Ad26.RSV.preF to protect against RSV infection and disease in an RSV human challenge model. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy adults aged 18-50 years were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 Ã— 1011 vp Ad26.RSV.preF or placebo intramuscularly. Twenty-eight days postimmunization, volunteers were challenged intranasally with RSV-A (Memphis 37b). Assessments included viral load (VL), RSV infections, clinical symptom score (CSS), safety, and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Postchallenge, VL, RSV infections, and disease severity were lower in Ad26.RSV.preF (n = 27) vs placebo (n = 26) recipients: median VL area under the curve (AUC) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: 0.0 vs 236.0 (P = .012; predefined primary endpoint); median VL-AUC quantitative culture: 0.0 vs 109; RSV infections 11 (40.7%) vs 17 (65.4%); median RSV AUC-CSS 35 vs 167, respectively. From baseline to 28 days postimmunization, geometric mean fold increases in RSV A2 neutralizing antibody titers of 5.8 and 0.9 were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF and placebo, respectively. Ad26.RSV.preF was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Ad26.RSV.preF demonstrated protection from RSV infection through immunization in a human challenge model, and therefore could potentially protect against natural RSV infection and disease.

Overlapping RSV and influenza seasonality presents the opportunity to coadminister vaccines for both infections. This study assessed coadministration of the investigational vaccine, Ad26.RSV.preF, an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation (pre-F), with a seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults. METHODS: In this phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 180 adults aged â‰¥60 years received Ad26.RSV.preF plus Fluarix on day 1 and placebo on day 29, or placebo plus Fluarix on day 1 and Ad26.RSV.preF on day 29 (control). RESULTS: The coadministration regimen had an acceptable tolerability profile. Reactogenicity was generally higher after Ad26.RSV.preF versus Fluarix, but symptoms were generally transient and mild or moderate. At 28 days after the first vaccination, the upper confidence intervals of the hemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean ratio (control/coadministration) for all influenza strains were <2, demonstrating noninferiority. Robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses to RSV A2 were observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of Fluarix with Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and showed no evidence of interference in immune response.

This phase 1/2, observer-blind, randomized, controlled study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vector RSV vaccine (ChAd155-RSV, expressing RSV F, N, and M2-1) in infants. METHODS: Healthy 6- to 7-month-olds were 1:1:1-randomized to receive 1 low ChAd155-RSV dose (1.5 Ã— 1010 viral particles) followed by placebo (RSV_1D); 2 high ChAd155-RSV doses (5 Ã— 1010 viral particles) (RSV_2D); or active comparator vaccines/placebo (comparator) on days 1 and 31. Follow-up lasted approximately 2 years. RESULTS: Two hundred one infants were vaccinated (RSV_1D: 65; RSV_2D: 71; comparator: 65); 159 were RSV-seronaive at baseline. Most solicited and unsolicited adverse events after ChAd155-RSV occurred at similar or lower rates than after active comparators. In infants who developed RSV infection, there was no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). RSV-A neutralizing titers and RSV F-binding antibody concentrations were higher post-ChAd155-RSV than postcomparator at days 31, 61, and end of RSV season 1 (mean follow-up, 7 months). High-dose ChAd155-RSV induced stronger responses than low-dose, with further increases post-dose 2. CONCLUSIONS: ChAd155-RSV administered to 6- to 7-month-olds had a reactogenicity/safety profile like other childhood vaccines, showed no evidence of VAERD, and induced a humoral immune response.

METHODS: In a phase 2a study, we randomly assigned healthy adults (18 to 50 years of age), in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a single intramuscular injection of either bivalent prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine or placebo. Approximately 28 days after injection, participants were inoculated intranasally with the RSV A Memphis 37b challenge virus and observed for 12 days. The per-protocol prespecified primary end points were the following: reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed detectable RSV infection on at least 2 consecutive days with at least one clinical symptom of any grade from two categories or at least one grade 2 symptom from any category, the total symptom score from day 1 to discharge, and the area under the curve (AUC) for the RSV viral load in nasal-wash samples measured by means of RT-qPCR from day 2 after challenge to discharge. In addition, we assessed immunogenicity and safety. RESULTS: After participants were inoculated with the challenge virus, vaccine efficacy of 86.7% (95% CI, 53.8 to 96.5) was observed for symptomatic RSV infection confirmed by any detectable viral RNA on at least 2 consecutive days. The median AUC for the RSV viral load (hoursâ€‰Ã—â€‰log(10) copies per milliliter) as measured by RT-qPCR assay was 0.0 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 19.0) in the vaccine group and 96.7 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 675.3) in the placebo group. The geometric mean factor increase from baseline in RSV A-neutralizing titers 28 days after injection was 20.5 (95% CI, 16.6 to 25.3) in the vaccine group and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3) in the placebo group. More local injection-site pain was noted in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF vaccine was effective against symptomatic RSV infection and viral shedding. No evident safety concerns were identified.

METHODS: In a phase 2b trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women, at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation, to receive either 120 or 240 Î¼g of RSVpreF vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. The trial included safety end points and immunogenicity end points that, in this interim analysis, included 50% titers of RSV A, B, and combined A/B neutralizing antibodies in maternal serum at delivery and in umbilical-cord blood, as well as maternal-to-infant transplacental transfer ratios. RESULTS: This planned interim analysis included 406 women and 403 infants; 327 women (80.5%) received RSVpreF vaccine. Most postvaccination reactions were mild to moderate; the incidence of local reactions was higher among women who received RSVpreF vaccine containing aluminum hydroxide than among those who received RSVpreF vaccine without aluminum hydroxide. The incidences of adverse events in the women and infants were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups; the type and frequency of these events were consistent with the background incidences among pregnant women and infants. The geometric mean ratios of 50% neutralizing titers between the infants of vaccine recipients and those of placebo recipients ranged from 9.7 to 11.7 among those with RSV A neutralizing antibodies and from 13.6 to 16.8 among those with RSV B neutralizing antibodies. Transplacental neutralizing antibody transfer ratios ranged from 1.41 to 2.10 and were higher with nonaluminum formulations than with aluminum formulations.

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine candidate in adults and children. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 1/2a, placebo-controlled study, 12 adults (18-50 years) and 36 RSV-seropositive children (12-24 months) were randomized 2:1 to Ad26.RSV.preF (1 Ã— 1011 viral particles [vp] for adults, 5 Ã— 1010 vp for children) or placebo, at day 1 and 29, with 6-month immunogenicity and 1-year safety follow-up. Respiratory syncytial virus infection was an exploratory outcome in children. RESULTS: In adults, solicited adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate, with no serious AEs. In children, no vaccination-related serious AEs were reported; fever was reported in 14 (58.3%) Ad26.RSV.preF recipients.

METHODS: This ongoing phase 3 study in â‰¥60-year-olds evaluates the immune persistence until three years post-RSVPreF3 OA vaccination. Here, we describe interim results on humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety until one year post-dose 1. RESULTS: In total, 1653 participants were vaccinated. One month post-dose 1, neutralization titers increased 10.5-fold (RSV-A) and 7.8-fold (RSV-B) versus pre-dose 1. Titers then declined to levels 4.4-fold (RSV-A) and 3.5-fold (RSV-B) above pre-dose 1 at month 6, and remained 3.1-fold (RSV-A) and 2.3-fold (RSV-B) above pre-dose 1 levels after one year. RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G levels and CD4+ T-cell frequencies showed similar kinetics. Solicited administration-site and systemic adverse events (mostly mild to moderate and transient) were reported by 62.2% and 49.5% of participants. Serious adverse events were reported by 3.9% of participants within 6 months post-dose 1; one case was considered vaccine-related. CONCLUSIONS: One RSVPreF3 OA dose elicited cell-mediated and RSV-A and RSV-B-specific humoral immune responses that declined over time but remained above pre-dose 1 levels for at least one year. The vaccine was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04732871.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of illness and hospitalization in older adults. An RSV vaccine for older adults developed by GSK was recently approved. The vaccine was well tolerated and provided protection against RSV disease in adults aged 60 years and older during at least one RSV season. In this ongoing study, we are evaluating the magnitude and durability of the immune response, as well as vaccine safety, until three years after vaccination of adults aged 60 years and older from five countries. Here, we report the results of an interim analysis until one year after vaccination with one dose. In total, 1653 participants were vaccinated. We found that the vaccine induced a strong immune response that was evident one month after vaccination, after which it declined, but persisted for at least one year. Study participants most often reported pain at the injection site, muscle pain, tiredness, and headache as adverse reactions, which were mostly mild to moderate and of short duration. One serious adverse reaction was considered related to the vaccine. The long-term immune response that was observed in this study is consistent with the vaccine providing protection during at least one RSV season.

This phase 1/2 study evaluated a bivalent prefusion F vaccine (RSVpreF) with antigens from RSV subgroups A and B. METHODS: Adults 18-49 years old (Nâ€…=â€…618) were randomized to receive placebo or 60, 120, or 240 Âµg RSVpreF with or without Al(OH)3. Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated. RESULTS: RSVpreF recipients more frequently reported local reactions and systemic events than placebo recipients; these were mostly mild or moderate. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred through 12 months postvaccination. All RSVpreF formulations induced 1-month postvaccination virus-neutralizing titers higher than those associated with protection of high-risk infants by palivizumab, the only prophylactic currently available for RSV. Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) across RSVpreF doses/formulations were 10.6-16.9 for RSV A and 10.3-19.8 for RSV B at 1 month postvaccination, greater than those historically elicited by postfusion F vaccines. GMFRs were 3.9-5.2 and 3.7-5.1, respectively, at 12 months postvaccination. CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF formulations were safe, well tolerated, and induced robust neutralizing responses in adults.

The efficacy and safety of an investigational bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine in this population are unknown. METHODS: In this ongoing, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults (â‰¥60 years of age) to receive a single intramuscular injection of RSVpreF vaccine at a dose of 120 Î¼g (RSV subgroups A and B, 60 Î¼g each) or placebo. The two primary end points were vaccine efficacy against seasonal RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two or at least three signs or symptoms. The secondary end point was vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated acute respiratory illness. RESULTS: At the interim analysis (data-cutoff date, July 14, 2022), 34,284 participants had received RSVpreF vaccine (17,215 participants) or placebo (17,069 participants). RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms occurred in 11 participants in the vaccine group (1.19 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 33 participants in the placebo group (3.58 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 66.7%; 96.66% confidence interval [CI], 28.8 to 85.8); 2 cases (0.22 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 14 cases (1.52 cases per 1000 person-years of observation), respectively, occurred with at least three signs or symptoms (vaccine efficacy, 85.7%; 96.66% CI, 32.0 to 98.7).

The incidence of local reactions was higher with vaccine (12%) than with placebo (7%); the incidences of systemic events were similar (27% and 26%, respectively). Similar rates of adverse events through 1 month after injection were reported (vaccine, 9.0%; placebo, 8.5%), with 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, considered by the investigators to be injection-related.

An mRNA-based RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, encoding the stabilized RSV prefusion F glycoprotein, is under clinical investigation. METHODS: In this ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2-3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive one dose of mRNA-1345 (50 Î¼g) or placebo. The two primary efficacy end points were the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and with at least three signs or symptoms. A key secondary efficacy end point was the prevention of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 35,541 participants were assigned to receive the mRNA-1345 vaccine (17,793 participants) or placebo (17,748). The median follow-up was 112 days (range, 1 to 379). The primary analyses were conducted when at least 50% of the anticipated cases of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease had occurred. Vaccine efficacy was 83.7% (95.88% confidence interval [CI], 66.0 to 92.2) against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and 82.4% (96.36% CI, 34.8 to 95.3) against the disease with at least three signs or symptoms. Vaccine efficacy was 68.4% (95% CI, 50.9 to 79.7) against RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Protection was observed against both RSV subtypes (A and B) and was generally consistent across subgroups defined according to age and coexisting conditions.
