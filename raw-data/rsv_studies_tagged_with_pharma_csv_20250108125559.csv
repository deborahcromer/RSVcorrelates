"Safety and immunogenicity evaluation of recombinant BCG vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial","Abarca, K.; Rey-Jurado, E.; Muñoz-Durango, N.; Vázquez, Y.; Soto, J. A.; Gálvez, N. M. S.; Valdés-Ferrada, J.; Iturriaga, C.; Urzúa, M.; Borzutzky, A.; Cerda, J.; Villarroel, L.; Madrid, V.; González, P. A.; González-Aramundiz, J. V.; Bueno, S. M.; Kalergis, A. M.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for most respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in infants and represents a significant economic burden for public health. The development of a safe, effective, and affordable vaccine is a priority for the WHO. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, escalating-dose phase 1 clinical trial in healthy males aged 18-50 years to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine expressing the nucleoprotein of RSV (rBCG-N-hRSV). Once inclusion criteria were met, volunteers were enrolled in three cohorts in an open and successive design. Each cohort included six volunteers vaccinated with 5 × 10(3), 5 × 10(4), or 1 × 10(5) CFU, as well as two volunteers vaccinated with the full dose of the standard BCG vaccine. This clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03213405) was conducted in Santiago, Chile. FINDINGS: The rBCG-N-RSV vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were recorded. Serum IgG-antibodies directed against Mycobacterium and the N-protein of RSV increased after vaccination, which were capable of neutralizing RSV in vitro. Additionally, all volunteers displayed increased cellular response consisting of IFN-γ and IL-2 production against PPD and the N-protein, starting at day 14 and 30 post-vaccination respectively. INTERPRETATION: The rBCG-N-hRSV vaccine had a good safety profile and induced specific cellular and humoral responses.

J.; Smolenov, I.; Lai, E.; Zaks, T.; Espeseth, A. S.; Panther, L.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections that can be severe and sometimes fatal. The risk for severe RSV infection is highest in infants and older adults. A safe and effective RSV vaccine for older adults represents a serious unmet medical need due to higher morbidity and mortality in this age group. In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The study was conducted in healthy younger adults (ages ≥18 and ≤49 years) and healthy older adults (ages ≥60 and ≤79 years). Participants received mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo as a single intramuscular dose. For each dose level, three sentinel participants were administered open-label mRNA-1777 (V171). Seventy-two younger adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, or 200 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo, and 107 older adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, 200 or 300 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and secondary objectives included humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity. All dose levels of mRNA-1777 (V171) were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Immunization with mRNA-1777 (V171) elicited a humoral immune response as measured by increases in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, D25 competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, and cell-mediated immune responses to RSV-F peptides.",2021,May 4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,17,5,1248-1261,33121346,10.1080/21645515.2020.1829899,,#33,Aliprantis 2021,"",Merck; adults; immunogenicity; nucleic acid vaccine; older adults; vaccine
"A Phase 1 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody MK-1654 in Healthy Adults","Aliprantis, A.

A.; Lai, E.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection and related morbidity and mortality in infants. Passive immunization with an RSV-neutralizing antibody can provide rapid protection to this vulnerable population. Proof-of-concept for this approach has been demonstrated by palivizumab; however, the use of this antibody is generally restricted to the highest-risk infants due to monthly dosing requirements and its cost. To address the large unmet medical need for most infants, we are evaluating MK-1654, a fully human RSV-neutralizing antibody with half-life extending mutations targeting site IV of the fusion protein. In this 2-part, placebo-controlled, double-blind, first-in-human study, 152 healthy adults were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of MK-1654 or placebo in 5 cohorts (100 or 300 mg as an intramuscular dose or 300, 1000, or 3000 mg as an intravenous dose). Safety, pharmacokinetics, antidrug antibodies, and RSV serum-neutralizing antibody titers were evaluated through 1 year. MK-1654 serum concentrations increased proportionally with dose and resulted in corresponding elevations in RSV serum-neutralizing antibody titers. The antibody displayed a half-life of 73 to 88 days and an estimated bioavailability of 69% at the 300-mg dose. The overall safety profile of MK-1654 was similar to placebo, and treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies were low (2.6%) with no associated adverse events. These data support the continued development of MK-1654 for the prevention of RSV disease in infants.",2021,May,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev,10,5,556-566,33125189,10.1002/cpdd.883,,#34,Aliprantis 2021,"",Merck; adults; immunogenicity; immunoprophylaxis; monoclonal antibody
"Local and Systemic Immunity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Induced by a Novel Intranasal Vaccine.

S.; van Roosmalen, M.; Grimaldi, R.; Zhang, Q.; Leenhouts, K.; Openshaw, P. J.; Chiu, C.","Rationale: Needle-free intranasal vaccines offer major potential advantages, especially against pathogens entering via mucosal surfaces. As yet, there is no effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a ubiquitous pathogen of global importance that preferentially infects respiratory epithelial cells; new strategies are urgently required.Objectives: Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a novel mucosal RSV F protein vaccine linked to an immunostimulatory bacterium-like particle (BLP).Methods: In this phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 48 healthy volunteers, aged 18-49 years, were randomly assigned to receive placebo or SynGEM (low or high dose) intranasally by prime-boost administration. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, with secondary objectives assessing virus-specific immunogenicity.Measurements and Main Results: There were no significant differences in adverse events between placebo and vaccinated groups. SynGEM induced systemic plasmablast responses and significant, durable increases in RSV-specific serum antibody in healthy, seropositive adults. Volunteers given low-dose SynGEM (140 μg F, 2 mg BLP) required a boost at Day 28 to achieve plateau responses with a maximum fold change of 2.4, whereas high-dose recipients (350 μg F, 5 mg BLP) achieved plateau responses with a fold change of 1.5 after first vaccination that remained elevated up to 180 days after vaccination, irrespective of further boosting. Palivizumab-like antibodies were consistently induced, but F protein site ∅-specific antibodies were not detected, and virus-specific nasal IgA responses were heterogeneous, with the strongest responses in individuals with lower pre-existing antibody levels.Conclusions: SynGEM is thus the first nonreplicating intranasal RSV subunit vaccine to induce persistent antibody responses in human volunteers.Clinical trials registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02958540).",2019,Aug 15,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,200,4,481-492,30753101,10.1164/rccm.201810-1921OC,,#66,Ascough 2019,Ainslie Hie (2024-11-26 13:51:30)(Included): extracted; ,NCT number; Virtuvax; adults; immunogenicity; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine
Safety and Immunogenicity of Bivalent RSVpreF Vaccine Coadministered With Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults,"Athan, E.; Baber, J.; Quan, K.; Scott, R.

C.; Gurtman, A.; Schmoele-Thoma, B.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are both typically seasonal diseases, with winter peaks in temperate climates. Coadministration of an RSV vaccine and influenza vaccine could be a benefit, requiring 1 rather than 2 visits to a healthcare provider for individuals receiving both vaccines. METHODS: The primary immunogenicity objective of this phase 3, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults aged ≥65 years in Australia was to demonstrate noninferiority of immune responses with coadministration of the stabilized RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) versus SIIV or RSVpreF administered alone, using a 1.5-fold noninferiority margin (lower bound 95% confidence interval >.667). Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collecting reactogenicity and adverse event data. RESULTS: Of 1403 participants randomized, 1399 received vaccinations (median age, 70; range, 65‒91 years). Local reactions and systemic events were mostly mild or moderate when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV or administered alone. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Geometric mean ratios were 0.86 for RSV-A and 0.85 for RSV-B neutralizing titers at 1 month after RSVpreF administration and 0.77 to 0.90 for strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay titers at 1 month after SIIV. All comparisons achieved the prespecified 1.5-fold noninferiority margin. CONCLUSIONS: The primary study objectives were met, demonstrating noninferiority of RSVpreF and SIIV immune responses when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV and that RSVpreF had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when coadministered with SIIV. The results of this study support coadministration of RSVpreF and SIIV in an older-adult population.

F.","OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants. We are developing an RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine for immunization of third trimester pregnant women to passively protect infants through transfer of RSV-specific maternal antibodies. The present trial was performed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of several formulations of RSV F vaccine in 1-dose or 2-dose schedules. METHODS: Placebo, or vaccine with 60μg or 120μg RSV F protein and 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8mg aluminum, were administered intramuscularly on Days 0 and 28 to healthy women 18-35years old. Immunogenicity was assessed from Days 0 through 91 based on anti-F IgG and palivizumab-competitive antibody (PCA) by ELISA, and RSV A and B neutralizing antibodies by microneutralization (MN) assay. Solicited adverse events were collected through Day 7 and unsolicited adverse events through Day 91. RESULTS: All formulations were well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Anti-F IgG and PCA responses were correlated and increased after both doses, while MN increased significantly only after the first dose, then plateaued. The timeliest and most robust antibody responses followed one dose of 120μg RSV F protein and 0.4mg aluminum, but persistence through 91days was modestly (∼25%) superior following two doses of 60μg RSV F protein and 0.8mg aluminum. Western blot analysis showed RSV infections in active vaccinees were reduced by 52% overall (p=0.009 overall) over the Day 0 through 90 period. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F nanoparticle vaccine formulations were well tolerated and immunogenic. The optimal combination of convenience and rapid response for immunization in the third trimester occurred with 120μg RSV F and 0.4mg aluminum, which achieved peak immune responses in 14days and sufficient persistence through 91days to allow for passive transfer of IgG antibodies to the fetus.

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a stabilized RSV prefusion F subunit (RSVpreF) vaccine candidate with/without adjuvant in adults aged 65-85 years. METHODS: Primary cohort participants were equally randomized to 1 of 7 RSVpreF formulations: 60 µg with either Al(OH)3 or CpG/Al(OH)3, 120 µg with either Al(OH)3 or CpG/Al(OH)3, 240 µg with either Al(OH)3 or CpG/Al(OH)3, 240 µg unadjuvanted, or placebo, administered concomitantly with high-dose seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV). Participants in the month 0,2 cohort were randomized to RSVpreF 240 µg with CpG/Al(OH)3 or placebo, administered at months 0 and 2. RESULTS: All RSVpreF vaccine candidates elicited robust and persistent serum neutralizing responses when administered alone or with SIIV. There was no notable difference in neutralizing response between the formulations, including those containing CpG. In the month 0,2 cohort, there was no booster effect of dose 2. SIIV responses were similar or slightly lower with concomitant administration of RSVpreF. Most systemic and local reactions were mild and more frequent after RSVpreF than placebo.

Equivalent immunogenicity across three RSVpreF vaccine lots in healthy adults 18-49 years of age: Results of a randomized phase 3 study,"Baker, J.; Aliabadi, N.; Munjal, I.; Jiang, Q.; Feng, Y.; Brock, L. G.; Cooper, D.; Anderson, A. S.; Swanson, K. A.; Gruber, W. C.; Gurtman, A.","BACKGROUND: Bivalent RSV prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF), comprised of equal quantities of stabilized prefusion F antigens from the major circulating subgroups (RSV A, RSV B), is licensed for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in older adults and for maternal vaccination for prevention of RSV-associated LRTI in infants. To support licensure and large-scale manufacturing, this lot consistency study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence in immunogenicity across 3 RSVpreF lots. METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1:1:1), double-blind study evaluated immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of RSVpreF in healthy 18-49-year-old adults. Participants received a single 120-µg injection of 1 of 3RSVpreF lots or placebo. Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of RSV serum 50 % neutralizing geometric mean titers obtained 1 month after vaccination were compared between each vaccine lot for RSV A and RSV B, separately. Equivalence between lots was defined using a 1.5-fold criterion (GMR 95 % CIs for every lot pair within the 0.667-1.5 interval). Safety and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Of 992participants vaccinated, 948 were included in the evaluable immunogenicity population. All 3 RSVpreF lots elicited strong immune responses, meeting the 1.5-fold equivalence criterion for all between-lot comparisons for both RSV A and RSV B. Across the 3 lots, RSV A and RSV B 50 % neutralizing geometric mean titers substantially increased from baseline (RSV A, 1671-1795; RSV B 1358-1429) to 1 month after RSVpreF vaccination (RSV A, 24,131-25,238; RSV B, 19,238-21,702), corresponding to ≥14-fold increases in 50 % neutralizing titers for both RSV A and RSV B from before to 1 month after vaccination. Single doses of RSVpreF were safe and well tolerated, with similar safety profiles across the 3 RSVpreF lots.

N.; Henry, O.","BACKGROUND: In a phase 1/2 study, a maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate (RSVPreF3) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and efficiently increased RSV-specific humoral immune responses in non-pregnant women. METHODS: In this phase 2 observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (NCT04126213), the safety of RSVPreF3 (60 or 120 µg), administered during late second or third trimester, was evaluated in 213 18- to 40-year-old healthy pregnant women through 6 months postdelivery and their offspring through infancy; immunogenicity was evaluated through day 43 postdelivery and day 181 postbirth, respectively. RESULTS: RSVPreF3 was well tolerated. No pregnancy-related or neonatal adverse events of special interest were considered vaccine/placebo related. In the 60 and 120 µg RSVPreF3 groups: (1) neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers in mothers increased 12.7- and 14.9-fold against RSV-A and 10.6- and 13.2-fold against RSV-B, respectively, 1 month postvaccination and remained 8.9-10.0-fold over prevaccination at day 43 postdelivery; (2) nAb titers were consistently higher compared to placebo recipients; (3) placental transfer ratios for anti-RSVPreF3 antibodies at birth were 1.62 and 1.90, respectively, and (4) nAb levels in infants were highest at birth and declined through day 181 postbirth. CONCLUSIONS: RSVPreF3 maternal vaccination had an acceptable safety risk profile and induced robust RSV-specific immune responses with successful antibody transfer to their newborns. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04126213.WHAT IS THE CONTEXT? Infants, especially those less than 6 months of age, are at increased risk of lung infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, this risk could be reduced with maternal vaccination against RSV during pregnancy. A previous clinical trial found that a vaccine candidate (named RSVPreF3) was well tolerated when given to non-pregnant women. WHAT IS NEW? In pregnant women, RSVPreF3 was also well tolerated. Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events was similar between vaccine and placebo recipients. None of the serious adverse events or events of interest for pregnant women or newborns were considered related to the study intervention. One month after vaccination, mothers who received RSVPreF3 had 11–15 times higher levels of antibodies against RSV than before vaccination. These antibody levels remained similar until 43 days after delivery. In the infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with RSVPreF3, antibody levels were highest at birth, when levels were higher than in their mothers, and declined through day 181 postbirth. WHAT IS THE IMPACT? RSVPreF3 had an acceptable safety risk profile in pregnant women and their babies.

RSV F-024 evaluated safety: participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of 60 µg of nonadjuvanted RSV-PreF or Tdap. RESULTS: Both studies showed similar reactogenicity profiles for RSV-PreF and Tdap. No serious adverse events were considered vaccine related. In RSV F-020, geometric mean ratios of RSV-A neutralizing antibody levels at day 30 versus prevaccination were 3.1-3.9 in RSV-PreF recipients and 0.9 in controls. Palivizumab-competing antibody concentrations increased >14-fold in RSV-PreF recipients on day 30. RSV antibody titers waned after day 30 but remained well above baseline through day 90. CONCLUSIONS: All formulations of RSV-PreF boosted preexisting immune responses in 18-45-year old women with comparable immunogenicity. The RSV-PreF safety profile was similar to that of Tdap vaccine.",2018,Apr 23,J Infect Dis,217,10,1616-1625,29401325,10.1093/infdis/jiy065,,#119,Beran 2018,"",GSK; NCT number; adults; immunogenicity; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine
Live Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine Candidate Containing Stabilized Temperature-Sensitivity Mutations Is Highly Attenuated in RSV-Seronegative Infants and Children,"Buchholz, U.

A.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory illness in young children and lacks a vaccine. RSV cold-passage/stabilized 2 (RSVcps2) is a modification of a previously evaluated vaccine candidate in which 2 major attenuating mutations have been stabilized against deattenuation. METHODS: RSV-seronegative 6-24-month-old children received an intranasal dose of 105.3 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSVcps2 (n = 34) or placebo (n = 16) (International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials protocol P1114 and companion protocol CIR285). RSV serum neutralizing antibody titers before and 56 days after vaccination, vaccine virus infectivity (defined as vaccine virus shedding detectable in nasal wash and/or a ≥4-fold rise in serum antibodies), reactogenicity, and genetic stability were assessed. During the following RSV transmission season, participants were monitored for respiratory illness, with serum antibody titers measured before and after the season. RESULTS: A total of 85% of vaccinees were infected with RSVcps2 (median peak titer, 0.5 log10 PFU/mL by culture and 2.9 log10 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction analysis); 77% shed vaccine virus, and 59% developed a ≥4-fold rise in RSV-serum neutralizing antibody titers. Respiratory tract and/or febrile illness occurred at the same rate (50%) in the vaccine and placebo groups. Deattenuation was not detected at either of 2 stabilized mutation sites. CONCLUSIONS: RSVcps2 was well tolerated and moderately immunogenic and had increased genetic stability in 6-24-month-old RSV-seronegative children.

N.; Germain, S.; Kuriyakose, S. O.; Lambert, A.; Descamps, D.; Olivier, A.; Hulstrøm, V.","BACKGROUND: Co-administration of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza can be considered given their overlapping seasonality, and may increase vaccine uptake and compliance. In this phase 3, open-label, randomized study, we evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) when co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLU-QIV) in older adults. METHODS: Participants aged ≥60 years (randomized 1:1) received either RSVPreF3 OA and FLU-QIV simultaneously on day 1 (Co-Ad group) or FLU-QIV on day 1 followed by RSVPreF3 OA on day 31 (sequential administration [SA] group). The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of RSVPreF3 OA in terms of RSV-A neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and FLU-QIV in terms of hemagglutination inhibition GMT ratio for each FLU-QIV strain, when co-administered versus when administered alone at 1-month post-vaccination. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interview of the group GMT ratio (SA/Co-Ad) was ≤1.5. Secondary descriptive objectives comprised additional immunogenicity assessments, reactogenicity, and safety. RESULTS: Of the 885 participants who received one dose of the study vaccines, 837 were included in the per protocol set. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. Both co-primary objectives were met for both vaccines. Reported adverse events in both groups were mild-to-moderate, with a low frequency of grade 3 events. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study demonstrate that RSVPreF3 OA can be co-administered with FLU-QIV. Co-administration is well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile.

A prefusion-stabilized RSV F subunit vaccine elicits B cell responses with greater breadth and potency than a postfusion F vaccine,"Chang, L. A.; Phung, E.; Crank, M. C.; Morabito, K. M.; Villafana, T.; Dubovsky, F.; Falloon, J.; Esser, M. T.; Lin, B. C.; Chen, G. L.; Graham, B. S.; Ruckwardt, T. J.","There is currently no licensed vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Here, we assess the effect of RSV fusion protein (F) conformation on B cell responses in a post hoc comparison of samples from the DS-Cav1 [prefusion (pre-F)] and MEDI7510 [postfusion (post-F)] vaccine clinical trials. We compared the magnitude and quality of the serological and B cell responses across time points and vaccines. We measured RSV A and B neutralization, F-binding immunoglobulin G titers, and competition assays at week 0 (before vaccination) and week 4 (after vaccination) to evaluate antibody specificity and potency. To compare B cell specificity and activation, we used pre-F and post-F probes in tandem with a 17-color immunophenotyping flow cytometry panel at week 0 (before vaccination) and week 1 (after vaccination). Our data demonstrate that both DS-Cav1 and MEDI7510 vaccination robustly elicit F-specific antibodies and B cells, but DS-Cav1 elicited antibodies that more potently neutralized both RSV A and B. The superior potency was mediated by antibodies that bind antigenic sites on the apex of pre-F that are not present on post-F. In the memory (CD27(+)) B cell compartment, vaccination with DS-Cav1 or MEDI7510 elicited B cells with different epitope specificities. B cells preferentially binding the pre-F probe were activated in DS-Cav1-vaccinated participants but not in MEDI7510-vaccinated participants. Our findings emphasize the importance of using pre-F as an immunogen in humans because of its deterministic role in eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells.",2022,Dec 21,Sci Transl Med,14,676,eade0424,36542692,10.1126/scitranslmed.ade0424,,#191,Chang 2022,"",MedImmune; adults; immunogenicity; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine

This Phase I, randomized, observer-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluated an investigational vaccine against RSV (ChAd155-RSV) using the viral vector chimpanzee-adenovirus-155, encoding RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid, and transcription antitermination proteins. METHODS: Healthy 18-45-year-old adults received ChAd155-RSV, a placebo, or an active control (Bexsero) at Days (D) 0 and 30. An escalation from a low dose (5 × 109 viral particles) to a high dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) occurred after the first 16 participants. Endpoints were solicited/unsolicited and serious adverse events (SAEs), biochemical/hematological parameters, cell-mediated immunogenicity by enzyme-linked immunospot, functional neutralizing antibodies, anti RSV-F immunoglobin (Ig) G, and ChAd155 neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: There were 7 participants who received the ChAd155-RSV low dose, 31 who received the ChAd155-RSV high dose, 19 who received the placebo, and 15 who received the active control. No dose-related toxicity or attributable SAEs at the 1-year follow-up were observed. The RSV-A neutralizing antibodies geometric mean titer ratios (post/pre-immunization) following a high dose were 2.6 (D30) and 2.3 (D60). The ratio of the fold-rise (D0 to D30) in anti-F IgG over the fold-rise in RSV-A-neutralizing antibodies was 1.01. At D7 after the high dose of the study vaccine, the median frequencies of circulating B-cells secreting anti-F antibodies were 133.3/106 (IgG) and 16.7/106 (IgA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The median frequency of RSV-F-specific interferon γ-secreting T-cells after a ChAd155-RSV high dose was 108.3/106 PBMCs at D30, with no increase after the second dose.

R.; Klyashtornyy, V.; De Paepe, E.; Omoruyi, E.; van der Fits, L.; van Heesbeen, R.; Heijnen, E.; Callendret, B.; Sadoff, J.","BACKGROUND: Ad26.RSV.preF is an adenovirus serotype 26 vector-based respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine encoding a prefusion conformation-stabilized RSV fusion protein (preF) that demonstrated robust humoral and cellular immunogenicity and showed promising efficacy in a human challenge study in younger adults. Addition of recombinant RSV preF protein might enhance RSV-specific humoral immune responses, especially in older populations. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a study compared the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.preF alone and varying doses of Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein combinations in adults aged ≥60 years. This report includes data from cohort 1 (initial safety, n = 64) and cohort 2 (regimen selection, n = 288). Primary immunogenicity and safety analyses were performed 28 days postvaccination (cohort 2) for regimen selection. RESULTS: All vaccine regimens were well tolerated, with similar reactogenicity profiles among them. Combination regimens induced greater humoral immune responses (virus-neutralizing and preF-specific binding antibodies) and similar cellular ones (RSV-F-specific T cells) as compared with Ad26.RSV.preF alone. Vaccine-induced immune responses remained above baseline up to 1.5 years postvaccination. CONCLUSIONS: All Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimens were well tolerated.

"Safety and Efficacy of Nirsevimab in a Universal Prevention Program of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in Newborns and Infants in the First Year of Life in the Valle d'Aosta Region, Italy, in the 2023-2024 Epidemic Season","Consolati, A.; Farinelli, M.; Serravalle, P.; Rollandin, C.; Apprato, L.; Esposito, S.; Bongiorno, S.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis remains a significant global health burden, particularly in newborns and infants during their first year of life. The quest for an effective preventive strategy against RSV has long been sought, and recent developments have shown promise in the form of nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody specifically designed for RSV prophylaxis. Valle d'Aosta was the first Italian region to propose universal prophylaxis with nirsevimab for newborns and infants in their first epidemic season as early as 2023-2024. This study describes the effectiveness and safety of the universal prevention program of RSV bronchiolitis using the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab in children resident in Valle d'Aosta born during the 2023-2024 epidemic season. There were 556 neonates born from 1 May 2023 to 15 February 2024. The risk of hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis in 2023-2024 was 3.2%, compared to 7% in the 2022-2023 epidemic season (p < 0.001). After the start of the prophylaxis campaign with nirsevimab, the risk of hospitalization was 8.3% in the sample of infants who did not adhere to the prophylaxis, while no child in the sample of those treated (p < 0.001) was hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Few mild transient side effects were reported. This study shows the efficacy and safety of universal prophylaxis with nirsevimab in neonates, making Valle d'Aosta the first Italian region to offer universal prophylaxis to newborns without risk factors for RSV complications.

K.; Webster, P.; Dormitzer, P. R.","BACKGROUND: Vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during pregnancy may protect infants from RSV disease. Efficacy and safety data on a candidate RSV prefusion F protein-based maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3-Mat) are needed. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 trial involving pregnant women 18 to 49 years of age to assess the efficacy and safety of RSVPreF3-Mat. The women were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive RSVPreF3-Mat or placebo between 24 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 0 days of gestation. The primary outcomes were any or severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants from birth to 6 months of age and safety in infants from birth to 12 months of age. After the observation of a higher risk of preterm birth in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, enrollment and vaccination were stopped early, and exploratory analyses of the safety signal of preterm birth were performed. RESULTS: The analyses included 5328 pregnant women and 5233 infants; the target enrollment of approximately 10,000 pregnant women and their infants was not reached because enrollment was stopped early. A total of 3426 infants in the vaccine group and 1711 infants in the placebo group were followed from birth to 6 months of age; 16 and 24 infants, respectively, had any medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 65.5%; 95% credible interval, 37.5 to 82.0), and 8 and 14, respectively, had severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 69.0%; 95% credible interval, 33.0 to 87.6). Preterm birth occurred in 6.8% of the infants (237 of 3494) in the vaccine group and in 4.9% of those (86 of 1739) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.74; P = 0.01); neonatal death occurred in 0.4% (13 of 3494) and 0.2% (3 of 1739), respectively (relative risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 0.62 to 7.56; P = 0.23), an imbalance probably attributable to the greater percentage of preterm births in the vaccine group. No other safety signal was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, in which enrollment was stopped early because of safety concerns, suggest that the risks of any and severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease among infants were lower with the candidate maternal RSV vaccine than with placebo but that the risk of preterm birth was higher with the candidate vaccine.

This was a phase I/II trial (NCT02927873) of ChAd155-RSV, an investigational chimpanzee adenovirus-RSV vaccine expressing 3 proteins (fusion, nucleoprotein, and M2-1), administered to 12-23-month-old RSV-seropositive children followed up for 2 years after vaccination. METHODS: Children were randomized to receive 2 doses of ChAd155-RSV or placebo (at a 1:1 ratio) (days 1 and 31). Doses escalated from 0.5 × 1010 (low dose [LD]) to 1.5 × 1010 (medium dose [MD]) to 5 × 1010 (high dose [HD]) viral particles after safety assessment. Study end points included anti-RSV-A neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers through year 1 and safety through year 2. RESULTS: Eighty-two participants were vaccinated, including 11, 14, and 18 in the RSV-LD, RSV-MD, and RSV-HD groups, respectively, and 39 in the placebo groups. Solicited adverse events were similar across groups, except for fever (more frequent with RSV-HD). Most fevers were mild (≤38.5°C).

RESULTS: A total of 8058 infants were randomly assigned to receive nirsevimab (4037 infants) or standard care (4021 infants). Eleven infants (0.3%) in the nirsevimab group and 60 (1.5%) in the standard-care group were hospitalized for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, which corresponded to a nirsevimab efficacy of 83.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.8 to 92.0; P<0.001). Very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 5 infants (0.1%) in the nirsevimab group and in 19 (0.5%) in the standard-care group, which represented a nirsevimab efficacy of 75.7% (95% CI, 32.8 to 92.9; P = 0.004). The efficacy of nirsevimab against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 89.6% (adjusted 95% CI, 58.8 to 98.7; multiplicity-adjusted P<0.001) in France, 74.2% (adjusted 95% CI, 27.9 to 92.5; multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.006) in Germany, and 83.4% (adjusted 95% CI, 34.3 to 97.6; multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.003) in the United Kingdom. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 86 infants (2.1%) in the nirsevimab group. CONCLUSIONS: Nirsevimab protected infants against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and against very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in conditions that approximated real-world settings.

Nirsevimab immunoprophylaxis was approved in the European Union for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants during their first RSV season. We evaluated the effectiveness of nirsevimab in preventing hospitalisations for confirmed RSV infection and the impact of a strategy of immunisation at birth. A population-based cohort study was performed in Navarre, Spain, where nirsevimab was offered at birth to all children born from October to December 2023. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of hospitalisation for PCR-confirmed RSV infection between infants who received and did not receive nirsevimab. Of 1177 infants studied, 1083 (92.0%) received nirsevimab. The risk of hospitalisation for RSV was 8.5% (8/94) among non-immunised infants versus 0.7% (8/1083) in those that were immunised. The estimated effectiveness of nirsevimab was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 69.6-95.8). Immunisation at birth of infants born between October and December 2023 prevented one hospitalisation for every 15.3 immunised infants. Immunisation of children born from September to January might prevent 77.5% of preventable hospitalisations for RSV in infants born in 2023-2024. These results support the recommendation of nirsevimab immunisation at birth to children born during the RSV epidemic or in the months immediately before to prevent severe RSV infections and alleviate the overload of paediatric hospital resources.",2024,Apr 4,Vaccines (Basel),12,4,,38675765,10.3390/vaccines12040383,,#326,Ezpeleta 2024,"",AstraZeneca-Sanofi; efficacy/effectiveness; immunoprophylaxis; infants/children; monoclonal antibody; observational study

T.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant illness in older adults resulting in substantial health and economic impact. A successful vaccine would reduce morbidity in this growing segment of the population. METHODS: In this double-blind phase 1 study, subjects 60 years of age and older were enrolled by cohort and randomized to receive vaccines containing escalating doses (20, 50, or 80μg) of soluble RSV fusion protein (sF) alone or adjuvanted with 2.5μg of glucopyranosyl lipid A, a toll-like receptor-4 agonist, in 2% stable emulsion (GLA-SE). Each cohort included 20 vaccine and 4 placebo recipients. Immune responses were evaluated using assays for RSV microneutralizing, anti-F IgG, and palivizumab competitive antibodies and for F-specific interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) responses. RESULTS: The inclusion of adjuvant increased local reactogenicity, with the majority of subjects who received sF and adjuvant reporting low-grade injection site pain or tenderness. At all doses, the safety profile was acceptable for further development. Immune responses were antigen dose-dependent, and the inclusion of adjuvant increased both humoral and cellular immune responses, with responses statistically higher than for placebo recipients in all 4 assays. At the highest dosage level with adjuvant, half of the subjects had a ≥3-fold rise from day 0 in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, and all had a ≥3-fold rise in antibody levels by anti-F IgG and palivizumab competitive antibody assays on day 29. For the day 8 IFNγ ELISPOT assay, 74% of subjects in the highest dosing cohort had a ≥3-fold rise from baseline.

No RSV vaccines have shown three-season efficacy. We aimed to evaluate efficacy of Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein over three RSV seasons. METHODS: CYPRESS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study done at 40 US clinical research centres wherein adults aged 65 years or older were centrally randomly assigned 1:1 by computer algorithm to receive Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein or placebo (one intramuscular injection) on day 1. Investigators, participants, site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to vaccine allocation, except for individuals involved in preparation of study vaccinations. The primary endpoint (first occurrence of RSV-mediated LRTD meeting one of three case definitions) was previously reported. Here, the predefined exploratory endpoint of vaccine efficacy against RSV-positive LRTD was assessed in the per-protocol efficacy set (all participants randomly assigned and vaccinated without protocol deviations affecting efficacy) through season 1 and from day 365 until the end of season 3. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of randomly assigned and vaccinated participants. The secondary endpoint of safety through the first RSV season was previously reported; follow-up for selected safety outcomes (fatal adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation, serious adverse events, and vaccine-related serious adverse events) until study completion is reported here in all randomly assigned and vaccinated participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03982199 and is complete. FINDINGS: Of 6672 adults screened, 5782 participants (2891 each receiving vaccine or placebo) were enrolled and vaccinated between Aug 5 and Nov 13, 2019. The season 2 per-protocol efficacy set included 2124 vaccine recipients and 2126 placebo recipients (season 3: 864 and 881; across three seasons: 2795 and 2803, respectively).

Solicited adverse events (AEs) within four days, unsolicited AEs within 30 days, and serious AEs (SAEs) and potential immune-mediated diseases within six months post-vaccination were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 757 participants received RSVPreF3 OA, of whom 708 were included in the per-protocol set (234, 237, and 237 participants for each lot). Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated: GMC ratios were 1.06 (95 % CI: 0.94-1.21), 0.92 (0.81-1.04), and 0.87 (0.77-0.99) between the lot pairs (lot 1/2; 1/3; 2/3). For the three lots, the RSVPreF3-binding IgG concentration increased 11.84-, 11.29-, and 12.46-fold post-vaccination compared to baseline. The reporting rates of solicited and unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases were balanced between lots. Twenty-one participants reported SAEs; one of these-a case of atrial fibrillation-was considered by the investigator as vaccine-related. SAEs with a fatal outcome were reported for four participants, none of which were considered by the investigator as vaccine-related. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated lot-to-lot immunogenicity consistency of three RSVPreF3 OA vaccine lots and indicated that the vaccine had an acceptable safety profile.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05059301.",2024,Jun,Vaccine X,18,,100494,38746060,10.1016/j.jvacx.2024.100494,,#347,Ferguson 2024,"",GSK; NCT number; immunogenicity; older adults; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine
Immunogenicity and safety of a respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein (RSV F) nanoparticle vaccine in older adults,"Fries, L.; Shinde, V.; Stoddard, J. J.; Thomas, D. N.; Kpamegan, E.; Lu, H.; Smith, G.; Hickman, S. P.; Piedra, P.; Glenn, G. M.","BACKGROUND: A preventative strategy for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection constitutes an under-recognized unmet medical need among older adults. Four formulations of a novel recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90 μg RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) administered concurrently with a licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in older adult subjects were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in this randomized, observer-blinded study. RESULTS: A total of 220 healthy males and females ≥ 60 years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, were vaccinated concurrently with TIV and RSV F vaccine or placebo. All vaccine formulations produced an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or evidence of systemic toxicity. Vaccine-induced immune responses were rapid, rising as early as 7 days post-vaccination; and were comparable in all formulations in terms of magnitude, with maximal levels attained within 28 (unadjuvanted) or 56 (adjuvanted) days post-vaccination. Peak anti-F protein IgG antibody levels rose 3.6- to 5.6-fold, with an adjuvant effect observed at the 60 μg dose, and a dose-effect observed between the unadjuvanted 60 and 90 μg regimens. The anti-F response persisted through 12 months post-vaccination. Palivizumab-competitive antibodies were below quantifiable levels (<33 μg/mL) at day 0. The rise of antibodies with specificity for Site II peptide, and the palivizumab-competitive binding activity, denoting antibodies binding at, or in proximity to, antigenic Site II on the F protein, closely paralleled the anti-F response. However, a larger proportion of antibodies in adjuvanted vaccine recipients bound to the Site II peptide at high avidity. Day 0 neutralizing antibodies were high in all subjects and rose 1.3- to 1.7-fold in response to vaccination. Importantly, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with TIV did not impact the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not impact the immune response to the RSV F vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccine induced increases in measures of functional immunity to RSV in older adults and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Adjuvanted formulations provided additional immunogenicity benefit as compared to increasing antigen dose alone.

A.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. A recombinant RSV fusion protein nanoparticle vaccine (RSV F vaccine) candidate for maternal immunization was tested for safety and immunogenicity in women of childbearing age. METHODS: Three hundred thirty women (18-35 years) were randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of RSV F vaccine (60 or 90 µg) with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant, or placebo at days 0 and 28. Safety was evaluated over 180 days; immunogenicity and RSV infection rates were evaluated over 112 days. RESULTS: All vaccine formulations were well tolerated, without vaccine-related serious adverse events. Anti-F immunoglobulin G antibodies rose 6.5-15.6-fold, with significantly higher levels in 2-dose, adjuvanted regimens at day 56. Palivizumab-competitive antibody levels were undetectable at day 0 but increased up to 325 µg/mL at day 56. A 2.7- and 3.5-fold rise in RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralization antibodies were noted at day 56. Between days 56 and 112, 21% (12/56) of placebo recipients and 11% of vaccinees (26/244) showed evidence of a recent RSV infection (P = .04).

METHODS: Six formulations with (5, 15, 30 and 60 μg) and without (30 and 60 μg) aluminum phosphate (AdjuPhos) were administered intramuscularly on day 0 and 30 in a dose escalating fashion to healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Solicited and unsolicited events were collected through day 210. Immunogenicity measures taken at day 0, 30 and 60 included RSV A and B microneutralization, anti-F IgG, antigenic site II peptide and palivizumab competitive antibodies. RESULTS: The vaccine was well-tolerated, with no evident dose-related toxicity or attributable SAEs. At day 60 both RSV A and B microneutralization was significantly increased in vaccinees versus placebo. Across all vaccinees there was a 7- to 19-fold increase in the anti-F IgG and a 7- to 24-fold increase in the antigenic site II binding and palivizumab competitive antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The RSV F nanoparticle vaccine candidate was well tolerated without dose-related increases in adverse events.

The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60-75 years. METHODS: We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intra-muscular (IM) injection (n = 6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart (n = 6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), or no vaccine (n = 6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV- and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFNγ-producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4+/CD8+/Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay). RESULTS: The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4+/CD8+ IFNγ-producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFNγ-producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody.

J.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory infection in annual epidemics, with infants and the elderly at particular risk of developing severe disease and death. However, despite its importance, no vaccine exists. The chimpanzee adenovirus, PanAd3-RSV, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-RSV, are replication-defective viral vectors encoding the RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), and matrix (M2-1) proteins for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. We performed an open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy adults in which four different combinations of prime/boost vaccinations were investigated for safety and immunogenicity, including both intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) administration of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine. The vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the most common reported adverse events being mild injection site reactions. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. RSV neutralizing antibody titers rose in response to IM prime with PanAd3-RSV and after IM boost for individuals primed by the IN route. Circulating anti-F immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were observed after the IM prime and IM boost. RSV-specific T cell responses were increased after the IM PanAd3-RSV prime and were most efficiently boosted by IM MVA-RSV. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion after boost was from both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, without detectable T helper cell 2 (TH2) cytokines that have been previously associated with immune pathogenesis following exposure to RSV after the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine.

Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that provides RSV prophylaxis but requires 5 monthly injections and is approved only for infants who experience the greatest morbidity and mortality from RSV. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for prevention of RSV disease in healthy infants. MEDI8897 is a recombinant human RSV monoclonal antibody with a modified Fc region that extends its half-life and is being developed as RSV prophylaxis for all infants. In this phase 1, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study, 136 healthy adults were randomized to receive a single dose of MEDI8897 (n = 102) or placebo (n = 34) in 1 of 5 cohorts (300, 1,000, or 3,000 mg intravenously or 100 or 300 mg intramuscularly [i.m.]) and were monitored for 360 days.

Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody to the RSV fusion protein that has an extended half-life. The efficacy and safety of nirsevimab in healthy late-preterm and term infants are uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, infants who had been born at a gestational age of at least 35 weeks to receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo before the start of an RSV season. The primary efficacy end point was medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. The secondary efficacy end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. RESULTS: A total of 1490 infants underwent randomization: 994 were assigned to the nirsevimab group and 496 to the placebo group. Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 12 infants (1.2%) in the nirsevimab group and in 25 infants (5.0%) in the placebo group; these findings correspond to an efficacy of 74.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6 to 87.1; P<0.001) for nirsevimab. Hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 6 infants (0.6%) in the nirsevimab group and in 8 infants (1.6%) in the placebo group (efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, -8.6 to 86.8; P = 0.07).

We evaluated efficacy and safety of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose and of 2 RSVPreF3 OA doses given 1 year apart against RSV-LRTD over 2 RSV seasons post-dose 1. METHODS: In this phase 3, blinded trial, ≥60-year-olds were randomized (1:1) to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo pre-season 1. RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomized (1:1) to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV_revaccination group) or placebo (RSV_1dose group) pre-season 2; participants who received placebo pre-season 1 received placebo pre-season 2 (placebo group). Efficacy of both vaccine regimens against RSV-LRTD was evaluated over 2 seasons combined (confirmatory secondary objective, success criterion: lower limits of 2-sided confidence intervals [CIs] around efficacy estimates >20%). RESULTS: The efficacy analysis comprised 24,967 participants (RSV_1dose: 6227, RSV_revaccination: 6242, placebo: 12,498). Median efficacy follow-up was 17.8 months. Efficacy over 2 seasons of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose was 67.2% (97.5% CI: 48.2-80.0) against RSV-LRTD and 78.8% (95% CI: 52.6-92.0) against severe RSV-LRTD.

A.; Weidenthaler, H.; Stroukova, D.; Martin, B. K.; De Moerlooze, L.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant disease burden in older adults. MVA-BN-RSV is a novel poxvirus-vectored vaccine encoding internal and external RSV proteins. METHODS: In a phase 2a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy participants aged 18 to 50 years received MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, then were challenged 4 weeks later with RSV-A Memphis 37b. Viral load was assessed from nasal washes. RSV symptoms were collected. Antibody titers and cellular markers were assessed before and after vaccination and challenge. RESULTS: After receiving MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, 31 and 32 participants, respectively, were challenged. Viral load areas under the curve from nasal washes were lower (P = .017) for MVA-BN-RSV (median = 0.00) than placebo (median = 49.05). Total symptom scores also were lower (median = 2.50 and 27.00, respectively; P = .004). Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed or culture-confirmed infection was 79.3% to 88.5% (P = .022 and .013). Serum immunoglobulin A and G titers increased approximately 4-fold after MVA-BN-RSV vaccination. Interferon-γ-producing cells increased 4- to 6-fold after MVA-BN-RSV in response to stimulation with the encoded RSV internal antigens. Injection site pain occurred more frequently with MVA-BN-RSV. No serious adverse events were attributed to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: MVA-BN-RSV vaccination resulted in lower viral load and symptom scores, fewer confirmed infections, and induced humoral and cellular responses.

M.; Weidenthaler, H.; Samy, N.; Chaplin, P.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory disease in young children and the elderly. Protective immunity is not generated after repeated infections, but vaccination may hopefully prove effective. METHODS: This phase 2 clinical study investigated a multivalent RSV vaccine (MVA-BN-RSV) designed to induce broad antibody and cellular immune responses by encoding RSV surface proteins F, G (for both A and B subtypes), and internal antigens (M2, N). This study evaluated the immune response in adults aged ≥55 years to identify the optimal MVA-BN-RSV dose and vaccination schedule. RESULTS: A single dose increased the levels of neutralizing (plaque reduction neutralization test to RSV A and B) and total (IgG and IgA ELISA) antibodies (1.6 to 3.4-fold increase from baseline) and induced a broad Th1-biased cellular immune response (interferon-γ ELISPOT) to all 5 vaccine inserts (5.4 to 9.7-fold increases). Antibody responses remained above baseline for 6 months. A 12-month booster dose elicited a booster effect in antibody and T-cell responses (up to 2.8-fold from preboost levels). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: MVA-BN-RSV induces a broad immune response that persists at least 6 months and can be boosted at 12 months, without significant safety findings.

METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind trial conducted in 18 countries, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, pregnant women at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation to receive a single intramuscular injection of 120 μg of a bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine or placebo. The two primary efficacy end points were medically attended severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants within 90, 120, 150, and 180 days after birth. A lower boundary of the confidence interval for vaccine efficacy (99.5% confidence interval [CI] at 90 days; 97.58% CI at later intervals) greater than 20% was considered to meet the success criterion for vaccine efficacy with respect to the primary end points. RESULTS: At this prespecified interim analysis, the success criterion for vaccine efficacy was met with respect to one primary end point. Overall, 3682 maternal participants received vaccine and 3676 received placebo; 3570 and 3558 infants, respectively, were evaluated. Medically attended severe lower respiratory tract illness occurred within 90 days after birth in 6 infants of women in the vaccine group and 33 infants of women in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 81.8%; 99.5% CI, 40.6 to 96.3); 19 cases and 62 cases, respectively, occurred within 180 days after birth (vaccine efficacy, 69.4%; 97.58% CI, 44.3 to 84.1). Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness occurred within 90 days after birth in 24 infants of women in the vaccine group and 56 infants of women in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 57.1%; 99.5% CI, 14.7 to 79.8); these results did not meet the statistical success criterion. No safety signals were detected in maternal participants or in infants and toddlers up to 24 months of age. The incidences of adverse events reported within 1 month after injection or within 1 month after birth were similar in the vaccine group (13.8% of women and 37.1% of infants) and the placebo group (13.1% and 34.5%, respectively).

Safety and Immunogenicity of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine RSV/ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L in RSV-Seronegative Children,"Karron, R. A.; Luongo, C.; Mateo, J. S.; Wanionek, K.; Collins, P. L.; Buchholz, U. J.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading global cause of severe pediatric acute respiratory tract illness, and a vaccine is needed. RSV/ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L contains 2 attenuating elements: (1) deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and (2) deletion of codon 1313 of the RSV polymerase gene and the stabilizing missense mutation I1314L. This live vaccine candidate was temperature-sensitive, genetically stable, replication restricted, and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine-placebo ratio, 2:1) at 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive children and at 105 and 106 PFU in 21 and 30 RSV-seronegative children, respectively. RESULTS: In RSV-seronegative children, the 105 PFU dose was overattenuated, but the 106 PFU dose was well tolerated, infectious (RSV/ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L replication detected in 90% of vaccinees), and immunogenic (geometric mean serum RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer, 1:64). After the RSV season, 9 of 20 vaccinees had increases in the RSV titer that were significantly greater than those in 8 of 10 placebo recipients (1:955 vs 1:69, respectively), indicating that the vaccine primed for anamnestic responses after natural RSV exposure.

A.; Collins, P. L.; Buchholz, U. J.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe pediatric respiratory illness, and a safe and effective vaccine for use in infancy and early childhood is needed. We previously showed that deletion of the coding sequence for the viral M2-2 protein (ΔM2-2) down-regulated viral RNA replication and up-regulated gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of development of an attenuated vaccine with enhanced immunogenicity. RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 was therefore evaluated as a live intranasal vaccine in adults, RSV-seropositive children, and RSV-seronegative children. When results in RSV-seronegative children were compared to those achieved with the previous leading live attenuated RSV candidate vaccine, vaccine virus shedding was significantly more restricted, yet the postvaccination RSV-neutralizing serum antibody achieved [geometric mean titer (GMT) = 1:97] was significantly greater. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season showed that several seronegative RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 recipients had substantial antibody rises without reported illness, suggesting that the vaccine was protective yet primed for anamnestic responses to RSV.

Evaluation of the Live-Attenuated Intranasal Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine RSV/6120/ΔNS2/1030s in RSV-Seronegative Young Children,"Karron, R. A.; Luongo, C.; Woods, S.; Oliva, J.; Collins, P. L.; Buchholz, U.

RSV/6120/ΔNS2/1030s is a cDNA-derived live-vaccine candidate attenuated by deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and the genetically stabilized 1030s missense polymerase mutation in the polymerase, conferring temperature sensitivity. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/6120/ΔNS2/1030s was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine to placebo ratio, 2:1) at 105.7 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive 12- to 59-month-old children, and at 105 PFU in 30 RSV-seronegative 6- to 24-month-old children. RESULTS: RSV/6120/ΔNS2/1030s infected 100% of RSV-seronegative vaccinees and was immunogenic (geometric mean RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer [RSV-PRNT], 1:91) and genetically stable. Mild rhinorrhea was detected more frequently in vaccinees (18/20 vaccinees vs 4/10 placebo recipients, P = .007), and LRI occurred in 1 vaccinee during a period when only vaccine virus was detected. Following the RSV season, 5 of 16 vaccinees had ≥4-fold rises in RSV-PRNT with significantly higher titers than 4 of 10 placebo recipients with rises (1:1992 vs 1:274, P = .02). Thus, RSV/6120/ΔNS2/1030s primed for substantial anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses following naturally acquired RSV infection.

METHODS: Two live attenuated, recombinantly derived RSV vaccine candidates, rA2cp248/404 Delta SH and rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH, were evaluated in 31 adults and in 95 children >/=6 months old. rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH was subsequently evaluated in 44 infants 1-2 months old. These vaccine candidates share 4 attenuating genetic elements and differ only in a missense mutation (1030) in the polymerase gene. RESULTS: Both vaccines were highly attenuated in adults and RSV-seropositive children and were well tolerated and immunogenic in RSV-seronegative children. Compared with that of rA2cp248/404 Delta SH, replication of rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH was restricted in RSV-seronegative children (mean peak titer, 10(4.3) vs. 10(2.5) plaque-forming units [pfu]/mL), indicating that the 1030 mutation had a potent attenuating effect. Although rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH was well tolerated in infants, only 44% of infants who received two 10(5.3)-pfu doses of vaccine had detectable antibody responses. However, replication after administration of the second dose was highly restricted, indicating that protective immunity was induced. At least 4 of 5 attenuating genetic elements were retained in recovered vaccine viruses.

An investigational vaccine using an engineered recombinant RSV fusion glycoprotein in its post-fusion conformation (RSV F subunit vaccine) has been developed to protect young infants via maternal immunization. This first-in-human, phase I, observer-blind study (NCT02298179) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different dosages and formulations of RSV F subunit vaccine in healthy non-pregnant women and men aged 18-45 years. METHODS: Participants were enrolled (1:1:1) in a stepwise dosage-escalation manner into three cohorts to receive RSV F subunit vaccine containing 45 µg, 90 µg and 135 μg of RSV F glycoprotein. Within each cohort, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive two doses of RSV F subunit vaccine with (aluminum hydroxide or MF59) or without adjuvant, or placebo, ≥28 days apart. Safety (until day 365 post-dose 2), anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and serum total binding antibodies to RSV F protein (until day 181 post-dose 1) were evaluated. RESULTS: All formulations were well-tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. All participants were seropositive for anti-RSV NAbs at baseline, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging from 184 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 127-266) to 380 (95% CI: 272-531).

RESULTS: V-306 was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels, with no increase in reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events between the first and second administrations. At 50 µg and 150 µg, V-306 induced an increase in FsIIm-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, which lasted at least 4 months. This did not translate into an increase in RSV-neutralizing antibody titers, which were already high at baseline. No increase in the anti-F protein-specific IgG titers was observed, which were also high in most subjects at baseline due to past natural infections. CONCLUSIONS: V-306 was safe and well-tolerated.

METHODS: This phase 1/2, randomized controlled, observer-blind study enrolled 48 young adults (YAs; aged 18-40 years) and 1005 older adults (OAs; aged 60-80 years) between January and August 2019. Participants were randomized into equally sized groups to receive 2 doses of unadjuvanted (YAs and OAs) or AS01-adjuvanted (OAs) vaccine or placebo 2 months apart. Vaccine safety and immunogenicity were assessed until 1 month (YAs) or 12 months (OAs) after second vaccination. RESULTS: The RSVPreF3 vaccines boosted humoral (RSVPreF3-specific immunoglobulin G [IgG] and RSV-A neutralizing antibody) responses, which increased in an antigen concentration-dependent manner and were highest after dose 1. Compared to prevaccination, the geometric mean frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells increased after each dose and were significantly higher in adjuvanted than unadjuvanted vaccinees. Postvaccination immune responses persisted until end of follow-up. Solicited adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and transient. Despite a higher observed reactogenicity of AS01-containing vaccines, no safety concerns were identified for any assessed formulation.

Safety and Immunogenicity of a Revaccination With a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prefusion F Vaccine in Older Adults: A Phase 2b Study,"Leroux-Roels, I.; Van Ranst, M.; Vandermeulen, C.; Abeele, C. V.; De Schrevel, N.; Salaun, B.; Verheust, C.; David, M. P.; Kotb, S.; Hulstrøm, V.","BACKGROUND: In the previous (parent) study, 2 doses of different formulations of an investigational vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSVPreF3 OA) were well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults. This multicenter phase 2b extension study assessed safety and immunogenicity of a revaccination (third) dose of the 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E formulation. METHODS: In total, 122 older adults (60-80 years), previously vaccinated with 2 doses of RSVPreF3-AS01E formulations (containing 30, 60, or 120 μg RSVPreF3 antigen), received an additional 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E dose 18 months after dose 2. Vaccine safety was evaluated in all participants up to 6 months and immunogenicity in participants who received 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E doses until 1 month after dose 3. RESULTS: Similar to the parent study, mostly mild-to-moderate solicited adverse events and no vaccine-related serious adverse events or potential immune-mediated disorders were reported. Neutralizing titers and cell-mediated immune responses persisted for 18 months after 2-dose vaccination. Dose 3 increased RSV-specific neutralizing titers against RSV-A and RSV-B and median CD4+ T-cell frequencies. After dose 3, RSV-specific neutralizing titers but not CD4+ T-cell frequencies were below levels detected 1 month after dose 1. CONCLUSIONS: Revaccination with 120 μg RSVPreF3-AS01E 18 months after dose 2 is well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04657198; EudraCT, 2020-000692-21.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious seasonal virus causing respiratory tract infections. In older adults, RSV can cause serious respiratory illnesses or worsen underlying medical conditions such as chronic diseases of the lungs or heart failure. Severe disease may lead to hospitalization, increased need for oxygen, and ventilatory support. However, several vaccines against RSV in older adults have recently been licensed in the United States and European Union. This study evaluated safety and immune responses after revaccination (third dose) with an adjuvanted vaccine against RSV in older adults aged 60–80 years, who had received 2 doses of the vaccine with a similar adjuvanted formulation in a previous (parent) study. Revaccination was done with the licensed vaccine formulation, which was also selected for further investigation in several phase 3 clinical trials. This study found that immune responses against RSV persisted above prevaccination levels for at least 18 months after the second vaccination in the parent study. The third vaccine dose was well tolerated and recalled the immune responses in older adults. Together with the ongoing confirmatory clinical trials, these results help better characterize this RSV vaccine, in terms of safety and RSV-specific immune responses elicited in older adults.eng",2024,Feb 14,J Infect Dis,229,2,355-366,37699064,10.1093/infdis/jiad321,,#692,Leroux-Roels 2024,"",GSK; NCT number; immunogenicity; older adults; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine

F.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the dominant cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, with the most severe cases concentrated among younger infants. METHODS: Healthy pregnant women, at 28 weeks 0 days through 36 weeks 0 days of gestation, with an expected delivery date near the start of the RSV season, were randomly assigned in an overall ratio of approximately 2:1 to receive a single intramuscular dose of RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine or placebo. Infants were followed for 180 days to assess outcomes related to lower respiratory tract infection and for 364 days to assess safety. The primary end point was RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection up to 90 days of life, and the primary analysis of vaccine efficacy against the primary end point was performed in the per-protocol population of infants (prespecified criterion for success, lower bound of the 97.52% confidence interval [CI] of ≥30%). RESULTS: A total of 4636 women underwent randomization, and there were 4579 live births. During the first 90 days of life, the percentage of infants with RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection was 1.5% in the vaccine group and 2.4% in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 39.4%; 97.52% CI, -1.0 to 63.7; 95% CI, 5.3 to 61.2). The corresponding percentages for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with severe hypoxemia were 0.5% and 1.0% (vaccine efficacy, 48.3%; 95% CI, -8.2 to 75.3), and the percentages for hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection were 2.1% and 3.7% (vaccine efficacy, 44.4%; 95% CI, 19.6 to 61.5). Local injection-site reactions among the women were more common with vaccine than with placebo (40.7% vs. 9.9%), but the percentages of participants who had other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccination in pregnant women did not meet the prespecified success criterion for efficacy against RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to 90 days of life. The suggestion of a possible benefit with respect to other end-point events involving RSV-associated respiratory disease in infants warrants further study.

F.; Eickhoff, M.; Esser, M. T.; Tang, R. S.; Dubovsky, F.","Despite substantial morbidity associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, there is no licensed vaccine. MEDI-559 is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine candidate being developed for prevention of lower respiratory illness due to RSV in young children. This randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated safety of MEDI-559 in healthy, RSV-seronegative children. MEDI-559 or placebo was administered on 3 occasions, 2 months apart. Primary safety was based on solicited symptoms (SSs) and adverse events (AEs) collected for 28 days after each dose. Nasal wash samples were collected 3 times after each dose (days 7-10, 12-18, 28-34) and at sick visits. Serum was collected for measuring antibody immune responses to RSV prior to first vaccination and 28 days post final dose. Long-term safety was monitored for 365 days from first dose. SSs were mild and frequent (MEDI-559 84%; placebo 91%); most common SSs were runny/stuffy nose, cough, and irritability/fussiness. AEs occurred in 67% MEDI-559 and 57% placebo recipients: most common AE was upper respiratory tract infection (MEDI-559 35%; placebo 23%). Higher incidence of medically attended lower respiratory illness within 28 days after dosing occurred in the MEDI-559 arm compared to placebo (none associated with vaccine virus shedding). There was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease. Vaccine virus was detected only in MEDI-559 recipients; shedding occurred in 56%subjects, primarily post dose 1. A functional immune response was observed in 59% and 9% MEDI-559 and placebo recipients, respectively, by an RSV microneutralization assay. Vaccine take, assessed by proportion that shed vaccine-type virus or had a seroresponse against RSV, was seen in 95% MEDI-559 subjects. MEDI-559 is therefore biologically active and immunogenic in this seronegative pediatric population. Although the frequency of SSs and AEs was not considered clinically significant, the increase in medically attended lower respiratory illnesses in the vaccine group warrants expanded safety studies.

Attenuated respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in asthmatic children,"McIntosh, K.; Arbeter, A. M.; Stahl, M. K.; Orr, I. A.; Hodes, D. S.; Ellis, E. F.","Extract: Two live “attenuated” respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines were administered intranasally and by aerosol in placebo-controlled trials among asthmatic children hospitalized at National Jewish Hospital and Research Center (NJH). The first vaccine, a 26° -adapted RSV vaccine, was given to 28 children, and a placebo control was given to 25. Twenty-one of 28 vaccinees (75%) had “takes,” as judged by virus shedding and/or rises in serum antibody and/or rises in nasal secretion neutralizing activity. No excess in wheezing was attributable to the vaccine administration, although there was a high background level of acute respiratory symptoms in both vaccinees and control subjects. In an outbreak of natural RSV infection which occurred some months after the vaccine was given, there was some evidence that those who received the vaccine less than 4 months before exposure to wild virus were protected against reinfection. Protection was not evident when this interval was greater than 4 months. The second vaccine, a temperature-sensitive mutant strain (ts-1), was administered to 22 children, and placebo to 21. Thirteen children (59%) had “takes.” In vaccinees under 6 years of age, 7 of 7 had “takes.” Again, no excess wheezing was seen in vaccinees as compared with control subjects, although there was some evidence that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in younger vaccinees. Four of 10 vaccinees shed virus with temperature-sensitive characteristics somewhat different from those of the vaccine strain. Vaccine virus was demonstrated to spread to uninoculated or placebo control children. Natural RSV challenge did not occur during the period of study. Speculation: One of two live “attenuated” RSV vaccines may have produced a brief period of protection against natural infection. This finding offers hope that such live vaccines might prevent disease in selected children over a critical time period, such as infants for the 1st year of life, or allergic or asthmatic children during periods of epidemic prevalence. Asthmatic children did not appear to develop symptoms of wheezing after attenuated RSV infection. This finding suggests that the mechanism of wheezing in asthmatic children with RSV infection may be dependent on, among other factors, the virulence of the virus strain (perhaps its capacity to replicate in and, possibly, invade the lower respiratory tract), rather than on an allergic response to antigens introduced into, and limited to, the upper airway. In view of the spread of the ts-1 vaccine and its apparent loss of temperature sensitivity in some vaccinees, the vaccine may have had the potential for reversion to virulence and hence initiation of epidemic disease. These characteristics are undesirable in live respiratory virus vaccines and should, if possible, be avoided in the development of future such vaccines.",1974,Jul,Pediatr Res,8,7,689-96,4601222,10.1203/00006450-197407000-00001,,#797,McIntosh 1974,"",NIAID; immunogenicity; infants/children; live attenuated/chimeric vaccine; vaccine

In August 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for infants aged <8 months to protect against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection during their first RSV season and for children aged 8-19 months at increased risk for severe RSV disease. In phase 3 clinical trials, nirsevimab efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with hospitalization was 81% (95% CI = 62%-90%) through 150 days after receipt; post-introduction effectiveness has not been assessed in the United States. In this analysis, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network evaluated nirsevimab effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization among infants in their first RSV season during October 1, 2023-February 29, 2024. Among 699 infants hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 59 (8%) received nirsevimab ≥7 days before symptom onset. Nirsevimab effectiveness was 90% (95% CI = 75%-96%) against RSV-associated hospitalization with a median time from receipt to symptom onset of 45 days (IQR = 19-76 days). The number of infants who received nirsevimab was too low to stratify by duration from receipt; however, nirsevimab effectiveness is expected to decrease with increasing time after receipt because of antibody decay. Although nirsevimab uptake and the interval from receipt of nirsevimab were limited in this analysis, this early estimate supports the current nirsevimab recommendation for the prevention of severe RSV disease in infants.

A single dose of the prefusion-stabilized fusion (F) glycoprotein subunit vaccine (DS-Cav1) substantially increases serum-neutralizing activity in healthy adults. We sought to determine whether DS-Cav1 vaccination induces a repertoire mirroring the pre-existing diversity from natural infection or whether antibody lineages targeting specific epitopes predominate. We evaluated RSV F-specific B cell responses before and after vaccination in six participants using complementary B cell sequencing methodologies and identified 555 clonal lineages. DS-Cav1-induced lineages recognized the prefusion conformation of F (pre-F) and were genetically diverse. Expressed antibodies recognized all six antigenic sites on the pre-F trimer. We identified 34 public clonotypes, and structural analysis of two antibodies from a predominant clonotype revealed a common mode of recognition. Thus, vaccination with DS-Cav1 generates a diverse polyclonal response targeting the antigenic sites on pre-F, supporting the development and advanced testing of pre-F-based vaccines against RSV.",2021,Apr 13,Immunity,54,4,769-780.e6,33823129,10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.004,,#866,Mukhamedova 2021,"",NIH/NIAID/VRC; adults; immunogenicity; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine
Safety and immunogenicity of respiratory syncytial virus purified fusion protein-2 vaccine in pregnant women,"Munoz, F. M.; Piedra, P. A.; Glezen, W.

Assessments included vaccine tolerability and safety in women and infants, and RSV-specific antibody measures in women before and after vaccination, at delivery and post partum. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated; no meaningful differences in pregnancy or infant outcomes were observed between study groups. RSV-specific antibody levels increased significantly among vaccine recipients, including responses competitive with well-described monoclonal antibodies specific for multiple RSV neutralizing epitopes. No significant antibody increase was seen among placebo recipients, although a shallow upward trend across the RSV season was noted. Transplacental antibody transfer was 90%-120% across assays for infants of vaccinated women.

Dissociation between serum neutralizing and glycoprotein antibody responses of infants and children who received inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine,"Murphy, B. R.; Prince, G. A.; Walsh, E. E.; Kim, H. W.; Parrott, R. H.; Hemming, V. G.; Rodriguez, W. J.; Chanock, R. M.","The serum antibody response of infants and children immunized with Formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine 20 years ago was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for the RSV fusion (F) and large (G) glycoproteins and a neutralization assay. Twenty-one young infants (2 to 6 months of age) developed a high titer of antibodies to the F glycoprotein but had a poor response to the G glycoprotein. Fifteen older individuals (7 to 40 months of age) developed titers of F and G antibodies comparable to those in children who were infected with RSV. However, both immunized infants and children developed a lower level of neutralizing antibodies than did individuals of comparable age with natural RSV infections. Thus, the treatment of RSV with Formalin appears to have altered the epitopes of the F or G glycoproteins or both that stimulate neutralizing antibodies, with the result that the immune response consisted largely of ""nonfunctional"" (i.e., nonneutralizing) antibodies. Subsequent natural infection of the vaccinees with wild-type RSV resulted in enhanced pulmonary disease. Despite this potentiation of illness, the infected vaccinees developed relatively poor G, F, and neutralizing antibody responses. Any or all of three factors may have contributed to the enhancement of disease in the RSV-infected vaccinees. First, nonfunctional antibodies induced by the inactivated RSV vaccine may have participated in a pulmonary Arthus reaction during RSV infection. Second, the poor antibody response of infants to the G glycoprotein present in the Formalin-inactivated vaccine may have been inadequate to provide effective resistance to subsequent wild-type virus infection. Third, the relatively reduced neutralizing antibody response of the infant vaccinees to wild-type RSV infection may have contributed to their enhanced disease by delaying the clearance of virus from their lungs.",1986,Aug,J Clin Microbiol,24,2,197-202,3755730,10.1128/jcm.24.2.197-202.1986,,#875,Murphy 1986,"",formalin inactivated; immunogenicity; infants/children; vaccine
Formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine induces antibodies to the fusion glycoprotein that are deficient in fusion-inhibiting activity,"Murphy, B. R.; Walsh, E. E.","The fusion (F) glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces neutralizing antibodies and antibodies that inhibit fusion of infected cells (FI antibody). It was previously shown that infants and children immunized with Formalin-inactivated RSV 20 years ago developed antibodies that bound to the F glycoprotein but were deficient in neutralizing activity. A reexamination of these sera indicated that they were also deficient in FI activity. Thus, Formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine stimulated an unbalanced immune response in which an unusually large proportion of the induced antibodies were directed against nonprotective epitopes rather than against the epitopes that induce functional antibodies, i.e., neutralizing and FI antibodies. This deficiency in stimulation of functional antibodies probably decreased the protective efficacy of the vaccine and could have contributed to potentiation of disease in the vaccines during subsequent RSV infection.",1988,Aug,J Clin Microbiol,26,8,1595-7,2459154,10.1128/jcm.26.8.1595-1597.1988,,#876,Murphy 1988,"",formalin inactivated; immunogenicity; infants/children; vaccine

Even though currently there are no approved hRSV vaccines for newborns or infants, several candidates are being developed. rBCG-N-hRSV is a vaccine candidate previously shown to be safe in a phase I clinical trial in adults (clinicaltrials.gov identifier #NCT03213405). Here, secondary immunogenicity analyses were performed on these samples. METHODS: PBMCs isolated from immunized volunteers were stimulated with hRSV or mycobacterial antigens to evaluate cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-derived molecules and the expansion of memory T cell subsets. Complement C1q binding and IgG subclass composition of serum antibodies were assessed. RESULTS: Compared to levels detected prior to vaccination, perforin-, granzyme B-, and IFN-γ-producing PBMCs responding to stimulus increased after immunization, along with their effector memory response. N-hRSV- and mycobacterial-specific antibodies from rBCG-N-hRSV-immunized subjects bound C1q. CONCLUSION: Immunization with rBCG-N-hRSV induces cellular and humoral immune responses, supporting that rBCG-N-hRSV is immunogenic and safe in healthy individuals.

P.; Van der Wielen, M.; Kostanyan, L.; Hulstrøm, V.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory infection, lower respiratory tract disease, clinical complications, and death in older adults. There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection. METHODS: In an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01(E)-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to show vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI], 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 62.4 to 99.9) against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (assessed on the basis of clinical signs or by the investigator) and 71.7% (95% CI, 56.2 to 82.3) against RSV-related acute respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy was similar against the RSV A and B subtypes (for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease: 84.6% and 80.9%, respectively; for RSV-related acute respiratory infection: 71.9% and 70.6%, respectively). High vaccine efficacy was observed in various age groups and in participants with coexisting conditions. The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but most adverse events for which reports were solicited were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. The incidences of serious adverse events and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and prevented RSV-related acute respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract disease and severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age or older, regardless of RSV subtype and the presence of underlying coexisting conditions.

R.; Chen, G.; Graham, B. S.","BACKGROUND: Multiple active vaccination approaches have proven ineffective in reducing the substantial morbidity and mortality caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and older adults (aged ≥65 years). A vaccine conferring a substantial and sustainable boost in neutralising activity is required to protect against severe RSV disease. To that end, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of DS-Cav1, a prefusion F subunit vaccine. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial, the stabilised prefusion F vaccine DS-Cav1 was evaluated for dose, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy adults aged 18-50 years at a single US site. Participants were assigned to receive escalating doses of either 50 μg, 150 μg, or 500 μg DS-Cav1 at weeks 0 and 12, and were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio within each dose group to receive the vaccine with or without aluminium hydroxide (AlOH) adjuvant. After 71 participants had been randomised, the protocol was amended to allow some participants to receive a single vaccination at week 0. The primary objectives evaluated the safety and tolerability at every dose within 28 days following each injection. Neutralising activity and RSV F-binding antibodies were evaluated from week 0 to week 44 as secondary and exploratory objectives. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose; secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analysis included all participants with available data at a given visit. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049488, and is complete and no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Feb 21, 2017, and Nov 29, 2018, 244 participants were screened for eligibility and 95 were enrolled to receive DS-Cav1 at the 50 μg (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH), 150 μg (n=35, of which n=15 with AlOH), or 500 μg (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH) doses. DS-Cav1 was safe and well tolerated and no serious vaccine-associated adverse events deemed related to the vaccine were identified. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited robust neutralising activity and binding antibodies by 4 weeks after a single vaccination (p<0·0001 for F-binding and neutralising antibodies). In analyses of exploratory endpoints at week 44, pre-F-binding IgG and neutralising activity were significantly increased compared with baseline in all groups. At week 44, RSV A neutralising activity was 3·1 fold above baseline in the 50 μg group, 3·8 fold in the 150 μg group, and 4·5 fold in the 500 μg group (p<0·0001). RSV B neutralising activity was 2·8 fold above baseline in the 50 μg group, 3·4 fold in the 150 μg group, and 3·7 fold in the 500 μg group (p<0·0001). Pre-F-binding IgG remained significantly 3·2 fold above baseline in the 50 μg group, 3·4 fold in the 150 μg group, and 4·0 fold in the 500 μg group (p<0·0001). Pre-F-binding serum IgA remained 4·1 fold above baseline in the 50 μg group, 4·3 fold in the 150 μg group, and 4·8 fold in the 500 μg group (p<0·0001). Although a higher vaccine dose or second immunisation elicited a transient advantage compared with lower doses or a single immunisation, neither significantly impacted long-term neutralisation. There was no long-term effect of dose, number of vaccinations, or adjuvant on neutralising activity. INTERPRETATION: In this phase 1 study, DS-Cav1 vaccination was safe and well tolerated. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited a robust boost in RSV F-specific antibodies and neutralising activity that was sustained above baseline for at least 44 weeks. A single low-dose of pre-F immunisation of antigen-experienced individuals might confer protection that extends throughout an entire RSV season.

Although RSV F is highly conserved, variation does exist between strains. Here, we characterized variations in the major viral antigenic sites among contemporary RSV sequences when compared with RSVPreF3 and showed that, in older adults, RSVPreF3-AS01 broadly boosts neutralization responses against currently dominant and antigenically distant RSV strains.

This study assessed the potential of Ad26.RSV.preF to protect against RSV infection and disease in an RSV human challenge model. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy adults aged 18-50 years were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 × 1011 vp Ad26.RSV.preF or placebo intramuscularly. Twenty-eight days postimmunization, volunteers were challenged intranasally with RSV-A (Memphis 37b). Assessments included viral load (VL), RSV infections, clinical symptom score (CSS), safety, and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Postchallenge, VL, RSV infections, and disease severity were lower in Ad26.RSV.preF (n = 27) vs placebo (n = 26) recipients: median VL area under the curve (AUC) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: 0.0 vs 236.0 (P = .012; predefined primary endpoint); median VL-AUC quantitative culture: 0.0 vs 109; RSV infections 11 (40.7%) vs 17 (65.4%); median RSV AUC-CSS 35 vs 167, respectively. From baseline to 28 days postimmunization, geometric mean fold increases in RSV A2 neutralizing antibody titers of 5.8 and 0.9 were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF and placebo, respectively. Ad26.RSV.preF was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Ad26.RSV.preF demonstrated protection from RSV infection through immunization in a human challenge model, and therefore could potentially protect against natural RSV infection and disease.

Overlapping RSV and influenza seasonality presents the opportunity to coadminister vaccines for both infections. This study assessed coadministration of the investigational vaccine, Ad26.RSV.preF, an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation (pre-F), with a seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults. METHODS: In this phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 180 adults aged ≥60 years received Ad26.RSV.preF plus Fluarix on day 1 and placebo on day 29, or placebo plus Fluarix on day 1 and Ad26.RSV.preF on day 29 (control). RESULTS: The coadministration regimen had an acceptable tolerability profile. Reactogenicity was generally higher after Ad26.RSV.preF versus Fluarix, but symptoms were generally transient and mild or moderate. At 28 days after the first vaccination, the upper confidence intervals of the hemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean ratio (control/coadministration) for all influenza strains were <2, demonstrating noninferiority. Robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses to RSV A2 were observed in both groups.

Approximately 28 days after injection, participants were inoculated intranasally with the RSV A Memphis 37b challenge virus and observed for 12 days. The per-protocol prespecified primary end points were the following: reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed detectable RSV infection on at least 2 consecutive days with at least one clinical symptom of any grade from two categories or at least one grade 2 symptom from any category, the total symptom score from day 1 to discharge, and the area under the curve (AUC) for the RSV viral load in nasal-wash samples measured by means of RT-qPCR from day 2 after challenge to discharge. In addition, we assessed immunogenicity and safety. RESULTS: After participants were inoculated with the challenge virus, vaccine efficacy of 86.7% (95% CI, 53.8 to 96.5) was observed for symptomatic RSV infection confirmed by any detectable viral RNA on at least 2 consecutive days. The median AUC for the RSV viral load (hours × log(10) copies per milliliter) as measured by RT-qPCR assay was 0.0 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 19.0) in the vaccine group and 96.7 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 675.3) in the placebo group. The geometric mean factor increase from baseline in RSV A-neutralizing titers 28 days after injection was 20.5 (95% CI, 16.6 to 25.3) in the vaccine group and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3) in the placebo group.

METHODS: In a phase 2b trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women, at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation, to receive either 120 or 240 μg of RSVpreF vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. The trial included safety end points and immunogenicity end points that, in this interim analysis, included 50% titers of RSV A, B, and combined A/B neutralizing antibodies in maternal serum at delivery and in umbilical-cord blood, as well as maternal-to-infant transplacental transfer ratios. RESULTS: This planned interim analysis included 406 women and 403 infants; 327 women (80.5%) received RSVpreF vaccine. Most postvaccination reactions were mild to moderate; the incidence of local reactions was higher among women who received RSVpreF vaccine containing aluminum hydroxide than among those who received RSVpreF vaccine without aluminum hydroxide. The incidences of adverse events in the women and infants were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups; the type and frequency of these events were consistent with the background incidences among pregnant women and infants. The geometric mean ratios of 50% neutralizing titers between the infants of vaccine recipients and those of placebo recipients ranged from 9.7 to 11.7 among those with RSV A neutralizing antibodies and from 13.6 to 16.8 among those with RSV B neutralizing antibodies. Transplacental neutralizing antibody transfer ratios ranged from 1.41 to 2.10 and were higher with nonaluminum formulations than with aluminum formulations. Across the range of assessed gestational ages, infants of women who were immunized had similar titers in umbilical-cord blood and similar transplacental transfer ratios. CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody responses with efficient transplacental transfer and without evident safety concerns.

Here, we describe interim results on humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety until one year post-dose 1. RESULTS: In total, 1653 participants were vaccinated. One month post-dose 1, neutralization titers increased 10.5-fold (RSV-A) and 7.8-fold (RSV-B) versus pre-dose 1. Titers then declined to levels 4.4-fold (RSV-A) and 3.5-fold (RSV-B) above pre-dose 1 at month 6, and remained 3.1-fold (RSV-A) and 2.3-fold (RSV-B) above pre-dose 1 levels after one year.

Vaccines developed substantial increases in anti-fusion and neutralizing antibody and exhibited protection against RSV infection through one RSV epidemic, in comparison to controls. This present study of the same cohort was undertaken to determine the persistence of antibody responses and immunity to reinfection, as well as to monitor for enhanced disease upon subsequent RSV infection during the second RSV season after vaccination. Vaccinees continued to have greater ELISA specific anti-fusion (F) antibody responses than controls up to 18 months after vaccination. Neutralizing antibody titres were not as durable, and the attack rates for RSV in the second winter season after vaccination (25% in vaccines versus 42% in controls) were not significantly different (p = 0.23).

L.; van Brummelen, E. M. J.; Jeeninga, R. E.; de Haan, C. A. M.; Roestenberg, M.; Burggraaf, J.; Kamerling, I. M. C.","BACKGROUND: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in early infancy and in elderly. A pediatric vaccine against RSV would not only prevent morbidity and mortality amongst infants and young children but could also reduce transmission to elderly. The RSVΔG vaccine consists of a live-attenuated RSV that lacks the G attachment protein. RSVΔG is severely impaired in binding to host cells and exhibits reduced infectivity in preclinical studies. Intranasal immunization of cotton rats with RSVΔG vaccine protected against replication of wildtype RSV, without inducing enhanced disease. METHODS: We performed a first-in-human trial with primary objective to evaluate safety and shedding of RSVΔG (6.5 log(10) CCID(50)) after intranasal administration. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 50, with RSV neutralizing serum titers below 9.6 log(2), received a single dose of either vaccine or placebo (n = 48, ratio 3:1). In addition to safety and tolerability, nasal viral load, and systemic and humoral immune responses were assessed at selected time points until 4 weeks after immunization. RESULTS: Intranasal administration of RSVΔG was well tolerated with no findings of clinical concern. No infectious virus was detected in nasal wash samples. Similar to other live-attenuated RSV vaccines, neutralizing antibody response following inoculation was limited in seropositive adults. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 6.5 log(10) CCID(50) of RSVΔG was safe and well-tolerated in seropositive healthy adults. RSVΔG was sufficiently attenuated but there were no signs of induction of antibodies. Safety and immunogenicity can now be explored in children and eventually in seronegative infants.

A.; Núñez, B. S.; Wählby-Hamrén, U.; Zhang, T.; Abram, M. E.; Leach, A.; Villafana, T.; Esser, M. T.","Nirsevimab is an extended half-life monoclonal antibody specific for the prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein, which has been studied in preterm and full-term infants in the phase 2b and phase 3 MELODY trials. We analyzed serum samples collected from 2,143 infants during these studies to characterize baseline levels of RSV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), duration of RSV NAb levels following nirsevimab administration, the risk of RSV exposure during the first year of life and the infant's adaptive immune response to RSV following nirsevimab administration. Baseline RSV antibody levels varied widely; consistent with reports that maternal antibodies are transferred late in the third trimester, preterm infants had lower baseline RSV antibody levels than full-term infants. Nirsevimab recipients had RSV NAb levels >140-fold higher than baseline at day 31 and remained >50-fold higher at day 151 and >7-fold higher at day 361. Similar seroresponse rates to the postfusion form of RSV F protein in nirsevimab recipients (68-69%) compared with placebo recipients (63-70%; not statistically significant) suggest that while nirsevimab protects from RSV disease, it still allows an active immune response. In summary, nirsevimab provided sustained, high levels of NAb throughout an infant's first RSV season and prevented RSV disease while allowing the development of an immune response to RSV.",2023,May,Nat Med,29,5,1172-1179,37095249,10.1038/s41591-023-02316-5,,#1379,Wilkins 2023,"",AstraZeneca-Sanofi; NCT number; immunogenicity; immunoprophylaxis; infants/children; monoclonal antibody
Phase 1 Safety and Immunogenicity Study of a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine With an Adenovirus 26 Vector Encoding Prefusion F (Ad26.RSV.preF) in Adults Aged ≥60 Years,"Williams, K.; Bastian, A. R.; Feldman, R. A.; Omoruyi, E.; de Paepe, E.; Hendriks, J.; van Zeeburg, H.; Godeaux, O.; Langedijk, J. P. M.; Schuitemaker, H.; Sadoff, J.; Callendret, B.","BACKGROUND: Despite the high disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults, there is no approved vaccine. We evaluated the experimental RSV vaccine, Ad26.RSV.preF, a replication-incompetent adenovirus 26 vector encoding the F protein stabilized in prefusion conformation. METHODS: This phase 1 clinical trial was performed in healthy adults aged ≥60 years. Seventy-two participants received 1 or 2 intramuscular injections of low-dose (LD; 5 × 1010 vector particles) or high-dose (HD; 1 × 1011 vector particles) Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine or placebo, with approximately 12 months between doses and 2-year follow-up for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were reported by 44% of vaccine recipients and were transient and mild or moderate in intensity. No serious adverse events were related to vaccination. After the first vaccination, geometric mean titers for RSV-A2 neutralization increased from baseline (432 for LD and 512 for HD vaccine) to day 29 (1031 for LD and 1617 for HD). Pre-F-specific antibody geometric mean titers and median frequencies of F-specific interferon γ-secreting T cells also increased substantially from baseline. These immune responses were still maintained above baseline levels 2 years after immunization and could be boosted with a second immunization at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Ad26.RSV.preF (LD and HD) had an acceptable safety profile and elicited sustained humoral and cellular immune responses after a single immunization in older adults.",2020,Aug 17,J Infect Dis,222,6,979-988,32320465,10.1093/infdis/jiaa193,,#1382,Williams 2020,"",Janssen Pharmaceuticals; NCT number; immunogenicity; older adults; recombinant vector vaccine; vaccine
Efficacy and Safety of an mRNA-Based RSV PreF Vaccine in Older Adults,"Wilson, E.; Goswami, J.; Baqui, A. H.; Doreski, P. A.; Perez-Marc, G.; Zaman, K.; Monroy, J.; Duncan, C. J.

K.; Kuter, B. J.; Schödel, F.; Huang, W.; Reuter, C.; Slobod, K.; Stoszek, S. K.; Shaw, C. A.; Miller, J. M.; Das, R.; Chen, G. L.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults. An mRNA-based RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, encoding the stabilized RSV prefusion F glycoprotein, is under clinical investigation. METHODS: In this ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2-3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive one dose of mRNA-1345 (50 μg) or placebo. The two primary efficacy end points were the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and with at least three signs or symptoms. A key secondary efficacy end point was the prevention of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 35,541 participants were assigned to receive the mRNA-1345 vaccine (17,793 participants) or placebo (17,748). The median follow-up was 112 days (range, 1 to 379). The primary analyses were conducted when at least 50% of the anticipated cases of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease had occurred. Vaccine efficacy was 83.7% (95.88% confidence interval [CI], 66.0 to 92.2) against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and 82.4% (96.36% CI, 34.8 to 95.3) against the disease with at least three signs or symptoms. Vaccine efficacy was 68.4% (95% CI, 50.9 to 79.7) against RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Protection was observed against both RSV subtypes (A and B) and was generally consistent across subgroups defined according to age and coexisting conditions. Participants in the mRNA-1345 group had a higher incidence than those in the placebo group of solicited local adverse reactions (58.7% vs. 16.2%) and of systemic adverse reactions (47.7% vs. 32.9%); most reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. Serious adverse events occurred in 2.8% of the participants in each trial group. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of the mRNA-1345 vaccine resulted in no evident safety concerns and led to a lower incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease than placebo among adults 60 years of age or older.

M.; Murphy, B. R.","A live-attenuated, intranasal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) candidate vaccine, cpts-248/404, was tested in phase 1 trials in 114 children, including 37 1-2-month-old infants-a target age for RSV vaccines. The cpts-248/404 vaccine was infectious at 104 and 105 plaque-forming units in RSV-naive children and was broadly immunogenic in children >6 months old. Serum and nasal antibody responses in 1-2 month olds were restricted to IgA, had a dominant response to RSV G protein, and had no increase in neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, there was restricted virus shedding on challenge with a second vaccine dose and preliminary evidence for protection from symptomatic disease on natural reexposure. The cpts-248/404 vaccine candidate did not cause fever or lower respiratory tract illness. In the youngest infants, however, cpts-248/404 was unacceptable because of upper respiratory tract congestion associated with peak virus recovery. A live attenuated RSV vaccine for the youngest infant will use cpts-248/404 modified by additional attenuating mutations.",2000,Nov,J Infect Dis,182,5,1331-42,11010838,10.1086/315859,,#1396,Wright 2000,"",NIH/Wyeth–Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics; immunogenicity; infants/children; live attenuated/chimeric vaccine; vaccine
The interferon antagonist NS2 protein of respiratory syncytial virus is an important virulence determinant for humans,"Wright, P. F.; Karron, R. A.; Madhi, S. A.; Treanor, J. J.; King, J.

R.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is targeted for vaccine development, because it causes severe respiratory tract illness in the elderly, young children, and infants. A primary strategy has been to derive live attenuated viruses for use in intranasally administered vaccines that will induce a protective immune response. In the present study, the NS2 gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes the host's interferon- alpha / beta response, was deleted from RSV vaccine candidates by use of reverse genetics. METHODS: Three NS2 gene-deleted RSV vaccine candidates were studied: rA2cp Delta NS2, rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2, and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2. rA2cp Delta NS2, which had the fewest attenuating mutations, was evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive children. rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2 were evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive and RSV-seronegative children. RESULTS: At a high dose (10(7.0) pfu), rA2cp Delta NS2 was not shed by adults, and only 13% of them had an immune response. The other vaccine candidates, rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2, had greatly decreased infectivity in RSV-seronegative children, compared with that of their immediate parent strains, which possess an intact NS2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of the NS2 gene attenuates RSV in subjects of all ages studied. This validates the strategy of developing live respiratory tract virus vaccines in which the virus's ability to inhibit the human innate immune system is blocked. rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 should be studied in children at a higher input titer, because it was more infectious and immunogenic than was rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2.",2006,Feb 15,J Infect Dis,193,4,573-81,16425137,10.1086/499600,,#1397,Wright 2006,"",NIH/Wyeth Vaccines; adults; immunogenicity; infants/children; live attenuated/chimeric vaccine; vaccine
