M.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for most respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in infants and represents a significant economic burden for public health. The development of a safe, effective, and affordable vaccine is a priority for the WHO. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, escalating-dose phase 1 clinical trial in healthy males aged 18-50 years to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine expressing the nucleoprotein of RSV (rBCG-N-hRSV). Once inclusion criteria were met, volunteers were enrolled in three cohorts in an open and successive design. Each cohort included six volunteers vaccinated with 5Â Ã—Â 10(3), 5Â Ã—Â 10(4), or 1Â Ã—Â 10(5) CFU, as well as two volunteers vaccinated with the full dose of the standard BCG vaccine. This clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03213405) was conducted in Santiago, Chile. FINDINGS: The rBCG-N-RSV vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were recorded. Serum IgG-antibodies directed against Mycobacterium and the N-protein of RSV increased after vaccination, which were capable of neutralizing RSV in vitro. Additionally, all volunteers displayed increased cellular response consisting of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 production against PPD and the N-protein, starting at day 14 and 30 post-vaccination respectively. INTERPRETATION: The rBCG-N-hRSV vaccine had a good safety profile and induced specific cellular and humoral responses.

J.; Smolenov, I.; Lai, E.; Zaks, T.; Espeseth, A. S.; Panther, L.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections that can be severe and sometimes fatal. The risk for severe RSV infection is highest in infants and older adults. A safe and effective RSV vaccine for older adults represents a serious unmet medical need due to higher morbidity and mortality in this age group. In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The study was conducted in healthy younger adults (ages â‰¥18 and â‰¤49Â years) and healthy older adults (ages â‰¥60 and â‰¤79Â years). Participants received mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo as a single intramuscular dose. For each dose level, three sentinel participants were administered open-label mRNA-1777 (V171). Seventy-two younger adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, or 200Â Âµg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo, and 107 older adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, 200 or 300Â Âµg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and secondary objectives included humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity. All dose levels of mRNA-1777 (V171) were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Immunization with mRNA-1777 (V171) elicited a humoral immune response as measured by increases in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, D25 competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, and cell-mediated immune responses to RSV-F peptides.",2021,May-04,Hum Vaccin Immunother,17,5,1248-1261,33121346,10.1080/21645515.2020.1829899,,#33,Aliprantis 2021,,Merck; No NCT number; Possible RCT; adults; immunogenicity; nucleic acid vaccine; older adults; vaccine
"A Phase 1 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody MK-1654 in Healthy Adults","Aliprantis, A.

A.; Lai, E.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection and related morbidity and mortality in infants. Passive immunization with an RSV-neutralizing antibody can provide rapid protection to this vulnerable population. Proof-of-concept for this approach has been demonstrated by palivizumab; however, the use of this antibody is generally restricted to the highest-risk infants due to monthly dosing requirements and its cost. To address the large unmet medical need for most infants, we are evaluating MK-1654, a fully human RSV-neutralizing antibody with half-life extending mutations targeting site IV of the fusion protein. In this 2-part, placebo-controlled, double-blind, first-in-human study, 152 healthy adults were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of MK-1654 or placebo in 5 cohorts (100 or 300Â mg as an intramuscular dose or 300, 1000, or 3000Â mg as an intravenous dose). Safety, pharmacokinetics, antidrug antibodies, and RSV serum-neutralizing antibody titers were evaluated through 1 year. MK-1654 serum concentrations increased proportionally with dose and resulted in corresponding elevations in RSV serum-neutralizing antibody titers. The antibody displayed a half-life of 73 to 88 days and an estimated bioavailability of 69% at the 300-mg dose. The overall safety profile of MK-1654 was similar to placebo, and treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies were low (2.6%) with no associated adverse events. These data support the continued development of MK-1654 for the prevention of RSV disease in infants.",2021,May,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev,10,5,556-566,33125189,10.1002/cpdd.883,,#34,Aliprantis 2021,,Merck; No NCT number; Possible RCT; adults; immunogenicity; immunoprophylaxis; monoclonal antibody
"Local and Systemic Immunity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Induced by a Novel Intranasal Vaccine.

S.; van Roosmalen, M.; Grimaldi, R.; Zhang, Q.; Leenhouts, K.; Openshaw, P. J.; Chiu, C.","Rationale: Needle-free intranasal vaccines offer major potential advantages, especially against pathogens entering via mucosal surfaces. As yet, there is no effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a ubiquitous pathogen of global importance that preferentially infects respiratory epithelial cells; new strategies are urgently required.Objectives: Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a novel mucosal RSV F protein vaccine linked to an immunostimulatory bacterium-like particle (BLP).Methods: In this phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 48 healthy volunteers, aged 18-49 years, were randomly assigned to receive placebo or SynGEM (low or high dose) intranasally by prime-boost administration. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, with secondary objectives assessing virus-specific immunogenicity.Measurements and Main Results: There were no significant differences in adverse events between placebo and vaccinated groups. SynGEM induced systemic plasmablast responses and significant, durable increases in RSV-specific serum antibody in healthy, seropositive adults. Volunteers given low-dose SynGEM (140 Î¼g F, 2 mg BLP) required a boost at Day 28 to achieve plateau responses with a maximum fold change of 2.4, whereas high-dose recipients (350 Î¼g F, 5 mg BLP) achieved plateau responses with a fold change of 1.5 after first vaccination that remained elevated up to 180 days after vaccination, irrespective of further boosting. Palivizumab-like antibodies were consistently induced, but F protein site âˆ…-specific antibodies were not detected, and virus-specific nasal IgA responses were heterogeneous, with the strongest responses in individuals with lower pre-existing antibody levels.Conclusions: SynGEM is thus the first nonreplicating intranasal RSV subunit vaccine to induce persistent antibody responses in human volunteers.Clinical trials registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02958540).",2019,Aug-15,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,200,4,481-492,30753101,10.1164/rccm.201810-1921OC,,#66,Ascough 2019,Ainslie Hie (2024-11-26 13:51:30)(Included): extracted; ,Mucosis; NCT number; Possible RCT; general adults; immunogenicity; product not taken forward to phase 3; protein subunit
Safety and Immunogenicity of Bivalent RSVpreF Vaccine Coadministered With Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults,"Athan, E.; Baber, J.; Quan, K.; Scott, R.

C.; Gurtman, A.; Schmoele-Thoma, B.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are both typically seasonal diseases, with winter peaks in temperate climates. Coadministration of an RSV vaccine and influenza vaccine could be a benefit, requiring 1 rather than 2 visits to a healthcare provider for individuals receiving both vaccines. METHODS: The primary immunogenicity objective of this phase 3, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults aged â‰¥65 years in Australia was to demonstrate noninferiority of immune responses with coadministration of the stabilized RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) versus SIIV or RSVpreF administered alone, using a 1.5-fold noninferiority margin (lower bound 95% confidence interval >.667). Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collecting reactogenicity and adverse event data. RESULTS: Of 1403 participants randomized, 1399 received vaccinations (median age, 70; range, 65â€’91 years). Local reactions and systemic events were mostly mild or moderate when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV or administered alone. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Geometric mean ratios were 0.86 for RSV-A and 0.85 for RSV-B neutralizing titers at 1 month after RSVpreF administration and 0.77 to 0.90 for strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay titers at 1 month after SIIV. All comparisons achieved the prespecified 1.5-fold noninferiority margin. CONCLUSIONS: The primary study objectives were met, demonstrating noninferiority of RSVpreF and SIIV immune responses when RSVpreF was coadministered with SIIV and that RSVpreF had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when coadministered with SIIV. The results of this study support coadministration of RSVpreF and SIIV in an older-adult population.

F.","OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants. We are developing an RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine for immunization of third trimester pregnant women to passively protect infants through transfer of RSV-specific maternal antibodies. The present trial was performed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of several formulations of RSV F vaccine in 1-dose or 2-dose schedules. METHODS: Placebo, or vaccine with 60Î¼g or 120Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8mg aluminum, were administered intramuscularly on Days 0 and 28 to healthy women 18-35years old. Immunogenicity was assessed from Days 0 through 91 based on anti-F IgG and palivizumab-competitive antibody (PCA) by ELISA, and RSV A and B neutralizing antibodies by microneutralization (MN) assay. Solicited adverse events were collected through Day 7 and unsolicited adverse events through Day 91. RESULTS: All formulations were well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Anti-F IgG and PCA responses were correlated and increased after both doses, while MN increased significantly only after the first dose, then plateaued. The timeliest and most robust antibody responses followed one dose of 120Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.4mg aluminum, but persistence through 91days was modestly (âˆ¼25%) superior following two doses of 60Î¼g RSV F protein and 0.8mg aluminum. Western blot analysis showed RSV infections in active vaccinees were reduced by 52% overall (p=0.009 overall) over the Day 0 through 90 period. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F nanoparticle vaccine formulations were well tolerated and immunogenic. The optimal combination of convenience and rapid response for immunization in the third trimester occurred with 120Î¼g RSV F and 0.4mg aluminum, which achieved peak immune responses in 14days and sufficient persistence through 91days to allow for passive transfer of IgG antibodies to the fetus.

Equivalent immunogenicity across three RSVpreF vaccine lots in healthy adults 18-49 years of age: Results of a randomized phase 3 study,"Baker, J.; Aliabadi, N.; Munjal, I.; Jiang, Q.; Feng, Y.; Brock, L. G.; Cooper, D.; Anderson, A. S.; Swanson, K. A.; Gruber, W.

To support licensure and large-scale manufacturing, this lot consistency study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence in immunogenicity across 3 RSVpreF lots. METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1:1:1), double-blind study evaluated immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of RSVpreF in healthy 18-49-year-old adults. Participants received a single 120-Âµg injection of 1 of 3RSVpreF lots or placebo. Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of RSV serum 50Â % neutralizing geometric mean titers obtained 1Â month after vaccination were compared between each vaccine lot for RSV A and RSV B, separately. Equivalence between lots was defined using a 1.5-fold criterion (GMR 95Â % CIs for every lot pair within the 0.667-1.5 interval). Safety and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Of 992participants vaccinated, 948 were included in the evaluable immunogenicity population. All 3 RSVpreF lots elicited strong immune responses, meeting the 1.5-fold equivalence criterion for all between-lot comparisons for both RSV A and RSV B. Across the 3 lots, RSV A and RSV B 50Â % neutralizing geometric mean titers substantially increased from baseline (RSV A, 1671-1795; RSV B 1358-1429) to 1Â month after RSVpreF vaccination (RSV A, 24,131-25,238; RSV B, 19,238-21,702), corresponding to â‰¥14-fold increases in 50Â % neutralizing titers for both RSV A and RSV B from before to 1Â month after vaccination.

N.; Henry, O.","BACKGROUND: In a phase 1/2 study, a maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate (RSVPreF3) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and efficiently increased RSV-specific humoral immune responses in non-pregnant women. METHODS: In this phase 2 observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (NCT04126213), the safety of RSVPreF3 (60 or 120 Âµg), administered during late second or third trimester, was evaluated in 213 18- to 40-year-old healthy pregnant women through 6 months postdelivery and their offspring through infancy; immunogenicity was evaluated through day 43 postdelivery and day 181 postbirth, respectively. RESULTS: RSVPreF3 was well tolerated. No pregnancy-related or neonatal adverse events of special interest were considered vaccine/placebo related. In the 60 and 120 Âµg RSVPreF3 groups: (1) neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers in mothers increased 12.7- and 14.9-fold against RSV-A and 10.6- and 13.2-fold against RSV-B, respectively, 1 month postvaccination and remained 8.9-10.0-fold over prevaccination at day 43 postdelivery; (2) nAb titers were consistently higher compared to placebo recipients; (3) placental transfer ratios for anti-RSVPreF3 antibodies at birth were 1.62 and 1.90, respectively, and (4) nAb levels in infants were highest at birth and declined through day 181 postbirth. CONCLUSIONS: RSVPreF3 maternal vaccination had an acceptable safety risk profile and induced robust RSV-specific immune responses with successful antibody transfer to their newborns. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04126213.WHAT IS THE CONTEXT? Infants, especially those less than 6 months of age, are at increased risk of lung infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, this risk could be reduced with maternal vaccination against RSV during pregnancy. A previous clinical trial found that a vaccine candidate (named RSVPreF3) was well tolerated when given to non-pregnant women. WHAT IS NEW? In pregnant women, RSVPreF3 was also well tolerated. Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events was similar between vaccine and placebo recipients. None of the serious adverse events or events of interest for pregnant women or newborns were considered related to the study intervention. One month after vaccination, mothers who received RSVPreF3 had 11â€“15 times higher levels of antibodies against RSV than before vaccination. These antibody levels remained similar until 43 days after delivery. In the infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with RSVPreF3, antibody levels were highest at birth, when levels were higher than in their mothers, and declined through day 181 postbirth. WHAT IS THE IMPACT? RSVPreF3 had an acceptable safety risk profile in pregnant women and their babies. This vaccine induced potent immune responses against RSV, with maternal antibodies transferred to infants of the vaccinated mothers.eng",2023,Aug-11,J Infect Dis,228,3,299-310,36722147,10.1093/infdis/jiad024,,#108,Bebia 2023,,GSK; NCT number; Possible RCT; females only; formulation taken forward to phase 3; immunogenicity; maternal; product taken forward to phase 3; protein subunit; under 1 year

Some children who did not have detectable prevaccine ELISA antibody possessed NEUT antibody; these children were generally less than 12 months old, suggesting that they had low levels of maternal antibody. Low levels of NEUT or ELISA antibody were associated with the absence of antibody increases after injection of live RS virus vaccine.

C.; Picciolato, M.; Dieussaert, I.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia in neonates and infants. RSV vaccination during pregnancy could boost preexisting neutralizing antibody titers, providing passive protection to newborns. METHODS: Two observer-blinded, controlled studies (RSV F-020 [clinical trials registration NCT02360475] and RSV F-024 [NCT02753413]) evaluated immunogenicity and safety of an investigational RSV vaccine in healthy, nonpregnant 18-45-year-old women. Both studies used a licensed adult formulation of combined tetanus toxoid-diphtheria toxoid-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine as a control. RSV F-020 evaluated immunogenicity and safety: participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive 1 dose of RSV-prefusion F protein (PreF) vaccine containing 30 Âµg or 60 Âµg of nonadjuvanted RSV-PreF, 60 Âµg of aluminum-adjuvanted RSV-PreF, or Tdap. RSV F-024 evaluated safety: participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of 60 Âµg of nonadjuvanted RSV-PreF or Tdap. RESULTS: Both studies showed similar reactogenicity profiles for RSV-PreF and Tdap. No serious adverse events were considered vaccine related. In RSV F-020, geometric mean ratios of RSV-A neutralizing antibody levels at day 30 versus prevaccination were 3.1-3.9 in RSV-PreF recipients and 0.9 in controls. Palivizumab-competing antibody concentrations increased >14-fold in RSV-PreF recipients on day 30. RSV antibody titers waned after day 30 but remained well above baseline through day 90.

A.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory illness in young children and lacks a vaccine. RSV cold-passage/stabilized 2 (RSVcps2) is a modification of a previously evaluated vaccine candidate in which 2 major attenuating mutations have been stabilized against deattenuation. METHODS: RSV-seronegative 6-24-month-old children received an intranasal dose of 105.3 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSVcps2 (n = 34) or placebo (n = 16) (International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials protocol P1114 and companion protocol CIR285). RSV serum neutralizing antibody titers before and 56 days after vaccination, vaccine virus infectivity (defined as vaccine virus shedding detectable in nasal wash and/or a â‰¥4-fold rise in serum antibodies), reactogenicity, and genetic stability were assessed. During the following RSV transmission season, participants were monitored for respiratory illness, with serum antibody titers measured before and after the season. RESULTS: A total of 85% of vaccinees were infected with RSVcps2 (median peak titer, 0.5 log10 PFU/mL by culture and 2.9 log10 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction analysis); 77% shed vaccine virus, and 59% developed a â‰¥4-fold rise in RSV-serum neutralizing antibody titers. Respiratory tract and/or febrile illness occurred at the same rate (50%) in the vaccine and placebo groups. Deattenuation was not detected at either of 2 stabilized mutation sites. CONCLUSIONS: RSVcps2 was well tolerated and moderately immunogenic and had increased genetic stability in 6-24-month-old RSV-seronegative children.

N.; Germain, S.; Kuriyakose, S. O.; Lambert, A.; Descamps, D.; Olivier, A.; HulstrÃ¸m, V.","BACKGROUND: Co-administration of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza can be considered given their overlapping seasonality, and may increase vaccine uptake and compliance. In this phase 3, open-label, randomized study, we evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) when co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLU-QIV) in older adults. METHODS: Participants aged â‰¥60 years (randomized 1:1) received either RSVPreF3 OA and FLU-QIV simultaneously on day 1 (Co-Ad group) or FLU-QIV on day 1 followed by RSVPreF3 OA on day 31 (sequential administration [SA] group). The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of RSVPreF3 OA in terms of RSV-A neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and FLU-QIV in terms of hemagglutination inhibition GMT ratio for each FLU-QIV strain, when co-administered versus when administered alone at 1-month post-vaccination. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interview of the group GMT ratio (SA/Co-Ad) was â‰¤1.5. Secondary descriptive objectives comprised additional immunogenicity assessments, reactogenicity, and safety. RESULTS: Of the 885 participants who received one dose of the study vaccines, 837 were included in the per protocol set. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. Both co-primary objectives were met for both vaccines. Reported adverse events in both groups were mild-to-moderate, with a low frequency of grade 3 events. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study demonstrate that RSVPreF3 OA can be co-administered with FLU-QIV. Co-administration is well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile.

Here, we assess the effect of RSV fusion protein (F) conformation on B cell responses in a post hoc comparison of samples from the DS-Cav1 [prefusion (pre-F)] and MEDI7510 [postfusion (post-F)] vaccine clinical trials. We compared the magnitude and quality of the serological and B cell responses across time points and vaccines. We measured RSV A and B neutralization, F-binding immunoglobulin G titers, and competition assays at week 0 (before vaccination) and week 4 (after vaccination) to evaluate antibody specificity and potency. To compare B cell specificity and activation, we used pre-F and post-F probes in tandem with a 17-color immunophenotyping flow cytometry panel at week 0 (before vaccination) and week 1 (after vaccination). Our data demonstrate that both DS-Cav1 and MEDI7510 vaccination robustly elicit F-specific antibodies and B cells, but DS-Cav1 elicited antibodies that more potently neutralized both RSV A and B. The superior potency was mediated by antibodies that bind antigenic sites on the apex of pre-F that are not present on post-F. In the memory (CD27(+)) B cell compartment, vaccination with DS-Cav1 or MEDI7510 elicited B cells with different epitope specificities. B cells preferentially binding the pre-F probe were activated in DS-Cav1-vaccinated participants but not in MEDI7510-vaccinated participants.

This Phase I, randomized, observer-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluated an investigational vaccine against RSV (ChAd155-RSV) using the viral vector chimpanzee-adenovirus-155, encoding RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid, and transcription antitermination proteins. METHODS: Healthy 18-45-year-old adults received ChAd155-RSV, a placebo, or an active control (Bexsero) at Days (D) 0 and 30. An escalation from a low dose (5 Ã— 109 viral particles) to a high dose (5 Ã— 1010 viral particles) occurred after the first 16 participants. Endpoints were solicited/unsolicited and serious adverse events (SAEs), biochemical/hematological parameters, cell-mediated immunogenicity by enzyme-linked immunospot, functional neutralizing antibodies, anti RSV-F immunoglobin (Ig) G, and ChAd155 neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: There were 7 participants who received the ChAd155-RSV low dose, 31 who received the ChAd155-RSV high dose, 19 who received the placebo, and 15 who received the active control. No dose-related toxicity or attributable SAEs at the 1-year follow-up were observed. The RSV-A neutralizing antibodies geometric mean titer ratios (post/pre-immunization) following a high dose were 2.6 (D30) and 2.3 (D60). The ratio of the fold-rise (D0 to D30) in anti-F IgG over the fold-rise in RSV-A-neutralizing antibodies was 1.01. At D7 after the high dose of the study vaccine, the median frequencies of circulating B-cells secreting anti-F antibodies were 133.3/106 (IgG) and 16.7/106 (IgA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Addition of recombinant RSV preF protein might enhance RSV-specific humoral immune responses, especially in older populations. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a study compared the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.preF alone and varying doses of Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein combinations in adults aged â‰¥60 years. This report includes data from cohort 1 (initial safety, n = 64) and cohort 2 (regimen selection, n = 288). Primary immunogenicity and safety analyses were performed 28 days postvaccination (cohort 2) for regimen selection. RESULTS: All vaccine regimens were well tolerated, with similar reactogenicity profiles among them. Combination regimens induced greater humoral immune responses (virus-neutralizing and preF-specific binding antibodies) and similar cellular ones (RSV-F-specific T cells) as compared with Ad26.RSV.preF alone. Vaccine-induced immune responses remained above baseline up to 1.5 years postvaccination. CONCLUSIONS: All Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimens were well tolerated.

The quest for an effective preventive strategy against RSV has long been sought, and recent developments have shown promise in the form of nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody specifically designed for RSV prophylaxis. Valle d'Aosta was the first Italian region to propose universal prophylaxis with nirsevimab for newborns and infants in their first epidemic season as early as 2023-2024. This study describes the effectiveness and safety of the universal prevention program of RSV bronchiolitis using the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab in children resident in Valle d'Aosta born during the 2023-2024 epidemic season. There were 556 neonates born from 1 May 2023 to 15 February 2024. The risk of hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis in 2023-2024 was 3.2%, compared to 7% in the 2022-2023 epidemic season (p < 0.001). After the start of the prophylaxis campaign with nirsevimab, the risk of hospitalization was 8.3% in the sample of infants who did not adhere to the prophylaxis, while no child in the sample of those treated (p < 0.001) was hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Few mild transient side effects were reported.

K.; Webster, P.; Dormitzer, P. R.","BACKGROUND: Vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during pregnancy may protect infants from RSV disease. Efficacy and safety data on a candidate RSV prefusion F protein-based maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3-Mat) are needed. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 trial involving pregnant women 18 to 49 years of age to assess the efficacy and safety of RSVPreF3-Mat. The women were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive RSVPreF3-Mat or placebo between 24 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 0 days of gestation. The primary outcomes were any or severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants from birth to 6 months of age and safety in infants from birth to 12 months of age. After the observation of a higher risk of preterm birth in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, enrollment and vaccination were stopped early, and exploratory analyses of the safety signal of preterm birth were performed. RESULTS: The analyses included 5328 pregnant women and 5233 infants; the target enrollment of approximately 10,000 pregnant women and their infants was not reached because enrollment was stopped early. A total of 3426 infants in the vaccine group and 1711 infants in the placebo group were followed from birth to 6 months of age; 16 and 24 infants, respectively, had any medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 65.5%; 95% credible interval, 37.5 to 82.0), and 8 and 14, respectively, had severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (vaccine efficacy, 69.0%; 95% credible interval, 33.0 to 87.6). Preterm birth occurred in 6.8% of the infants (237 of 3494) in the vaccine group and in 4.9% of those (86 of 1739) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.74; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01); neonatal death occurred in 0.4% (13 of 3494) and 0.2% (3 of 1739), respectively (relative risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 0.62 to 7.56; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.23), an imbalance probably attributable to the greater percentage of preterm births in the vaccine group. No other safety signal was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, in which enrollment was stopped early because of safety concerns, suggest that the risks of any and severe medically assessed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease among infants were lower with the candidate maternal RSV vaccine than with placebo but that the risk of preterm birth was higher with the candidate vaccine.

No vaccine-related serious adverse events or RSV-related hospitalizations were reported. There was a dose-dependent increase in RSV-A Nab titers in all groups after dose 1, without further increase after dose 2. RSV-A Nab titers remained higher than prevaccination levels at year 1. CONCLUSIONS: Three ChAd155-RSV dosages were found to be well tolerated. A dose-dependent immune response was observed after dose 1, with no observed booster effect after dose 2. Further investigation of ChAd155-RSV in RSV-seronegative children is warranted. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02927873.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the main causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia regularly leading to hospitalization in children. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent RSV infection in this age group has not yet been found, despite great efforts over several decades. This study tested a new candidate RSV vaccine, expressing 3 important pieces of the virus, in toddlers who already had a previous RSV infection. The vaccine was generally well tolerated. Vaccination triggered antibodies against RSV that were able to block the virus in laboratory tests and that persisted for 1 year.eng",2023,May-29,J Infect Dis,227,11,1293-1302,36484484,10.1093/infdis/jiac481,,#280,DÃ­ez-Domingo 2023,,GSK; NCT number; Possible RCT; immunogenicity; product not taken forward to phase 3; viral vector; under 2 years

N.","BACKGROUND: The safety of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and the effect of nirsevimab on hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection when administered in healthy infants are unclear. METHODS: In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, infants who were 12 months of age or younger, had been born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, and were entering their first RSV season in France, Germany, or the United Kingdom to receive either a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or standard care (no intervention) before or during the RSV season. The primary end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospital admission and an RSV-positive test result. A key secondary end point was very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, defined as hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% and the need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 8058 infants were randomly assigned to receive nirsevimab (4037 infants) or standard care (4021 infants). Eleven infants (0.3%) in the nirsevimab group and 60 (1.5%) in the standard-care group were hospitalized for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, which corresponded to a nirsevimab efficacy of 83.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.8 to 92.0; P<0.001). Very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 5 infants (0.1%) in the nirsevimab group and in 19 (0.5%) in the standard-care group, which represented a nirsevimab efficacy of 75.7% (95% CI, 32.8 to 92.9; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). The efficacy of nirsevimab against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 89.6% (adjusted 95% CI, 58.8 to 98.7; multiplicity-adjusted P<0.001) in France, 74.2% (adjusted 95% CI, 27.9 to 92.5; multiplicity-adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) in Germany, and 83.4% (adjusted 95% CI, 34.3 to 97.6; multiplicity-adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) in the United Kingdom. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 86 infants (2.1%) in the nirsevimab group.

Nirsevimab immunoprophylaxis was approved in the European Union for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants during their first RSV season. We evaluated the effectiveness of nirsevimab in preventing hospitalisations for confirmed RSV infection and the impact of a strategy of immunisation at birth. A population-based cohort study was performed in Navarre, Spain, where nirsevimab was offered at birth to all children born from October to December 2023. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of hospitalisation for PCR-confirmed RSV infection between infants who received and did not receive nirsevimab. Of 1177 infants studied, 1083 (92.0%) received nirsevimab. The risk of hospitalisation for RSV was 8.5% (8/94) among non-immunised infants versus 0.7% (8/1083) in those that were immunised. The estimated effectiveness of nirsevimab was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 69.6-95.8). Immunisation at birth of infants born between October and December 2023 prevented one hospitalisation for every 15.3 immunised infants. Immunisation of children born from September to January might prevent 77.5% of preventable hospitalisations for RSV in infants born in 2023-2024.

T.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant illness in older adults resulting in substantial health and economic impact. A successful vaccine would reduce morbidity in this growing segment of the population. METHODS: In this double-blind phase 1 study, subjects 60 years of age and older were enrolled by cohort and randomized to receive vaccines containing escalating doses (20, 50, or 80Î¼g) of soluble RSV fusion protein (sF) alone or adjuvanted with 2.5Î¼g of glucopyranosyl lipid A, a toll-like receptor-4 agonist, in 2% stable emulsion (GLA-SE). Each cohort included 20 vaccine and 4 placebo recipients. Immune responses were evaluated using assays for RSV microneutralizing, anti-F IgG, and palivizumab competitive antibodies and for F-specific interferon (IFN)-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) responses. RESULTS: The inclusion of adjuvant increased local reactogenicity, with the majority of subjects who received sF and adjuvant reporting low-grade injection site pain or tenderness. At all doses, the safety profile was acceptable for further development. Immune responses were antigen dose-dependent, and the inclusion of adjuvant increased both humoral and cellular immune responses, with responses statistically higher than for placebo recipients in all 4 assays. At the highest dosage level with adjuvant, half of the subjects had a â‰¥3-fold rise from day 0 in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, and all had a â‰¥3-fold rise in antibody levels by anti-F IgG and palivizumab competitive antibody assays on day 29. For the day 8 IFNÎ³ ELISPOT assay, 74% of subjects in the highest dosing cohort had a â‰¥3-fold rise from baseline.

No RSV vaccines have shown three-season efficacy. We aimed to evaluate efficacy of Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein over three RSV seasons. METHODS: CYPRESS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study done at 40 US clinical research centres wherein adults aged 65 years or older were centrally randomly assigned 1:1 by computer algorithm to receive Ad26.RSV.preF-RSV preF protein or placebo (one intramuscular injection) on day 1. Investigators, participants, site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to vaccine allocation, except for individuals involved in preparation of study vaccinations. The primary endpoint (first occurrence of RSV-mediated LRTD meeting one of three case definitions) was previously reported. Here, the predefined exploratory endpoint of vaccine efficacy against RSV-positive LRTD was assessed in the per-protocol efficacy set (all participants randomly assigned and vaccinated without protocol deviations affecting efficacy) through season 1 and from day 365 until the end of season 3. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of randomly assigned and vaccinated participants. The secondary endpoint of safety through the first RSV season was previously reported; follow-up for selected safety outcomes (fatal adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation, serious adverse events, and vaccine-related serious adverse events) until study completion is reported here in all randomly assigned and vaccinated participants.

In an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicountry, phase 3 trial in â‰¥60-year-old participants, an AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) was efficacious against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD), severe RSV-LRTD, and RSV-ARI. We evaluated efficacy and immunogenicity among participants with coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV disease (""conditions of interest""). METHODS: Medically stable â‰¥60-year-old participants received 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. Efficacy against first RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI episodes was assessed in subgroups with/without coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions of interest. Immunogenicity was analyzed post hoc in these subgroups. RESULTS: In total, 12 467 participants received RSVPreF3 OA and 12 499 received placebo. Of these, 39.6% (RSVPreF3 OA) and 38.9% (placebo) had â‰¥1 coexisting condition of interest. The median efficacy follow-up was 6.7 months. Efficacy against RSV-LRTD was high in participants with â‰¥1 condition of interest (94.6%), â‰¥1 cardiorespiratory (92.1%), â‰¥1 endocrine/metabolic (100%), and â‰¥2 conditions of interest (92.0%). Efficacy against RSV-ARI was 81.0% in participants with â‰¥1 condition of interest (88.1% for cardiorespiratory, 79.4% for endocrine/metabolic conditions) and 88.0% in participants with â‰¥2 conditions of interest.

METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study randomized (1:1:1) participantsÂ â‰¥Â 60Â years of age to receive one of three RSVPreF3 OA lots. Serum RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration was assessed at baseline and 30Â days post-vaccination. Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated if the two-sided 95Â % confidence intervals (CIs) of the RSVPreF3-binding IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios between each lot pair at 30Â days post-vaccination were within 0.67 and 1.50. Solicited adverse events (AEs) within four days, unsolicited AEs within 30Â days, and serious AEs (SAEs) and potential immune-mediated diseases within six months post-vaccination were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 757 participants received RSVPreF3 OA, of whom 708 were included in the per-protocol set (234, 237, and 237 participants for each lot). Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated: GMC ratios were 1.06 (95Â % CI: 0.94-1.21), 0.92 (0.81-1.04), and 0.87 (0.77-0.99) between the lot pairs (lot 1/2; 1/3; 2/3). For the three lots, the RSVPreF3-binding IgG concentration increased 11.84-, 11.29-, and 12.46-fold post-vaccination compared to baseline. The reporting rates of solicited and unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases were balanced between lots. Twenty-one participants reported SAEs; one of these-a case of atrial fibrillation-was considered by the investigator as vaccine-related. SAEs with a fatal outcome were reported for four participants, none of which were considered by the investigator as vaccine-related.

N.; Kpamegan, E.; Lu, H.; Smith, G.; Hickman, S. P.; Piedra, P.; Glenn, G. M.","BACKGROUND: A preventative strategy for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection constitutes an under-recognized unmet medical need among older adults. Four formulations of a novel recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90Â Î¼g RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) administered concurrently with a licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in older adult subjects were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in this randomized, observer-blinded study. RESULTS: A total of 220 healthy males and femalesâ€‰â‰¥â€‰60Â years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, were vaccinated concurrently with TIV and RSV F vaccine or placebo. All vaccine formulations produced an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or evidence of systemic toxicity. Vaccine-induced immune responses were rapid, rising as early as 7Â days post-vaccination; and were comparable in all formulations in terms of magnitude, with maximal levels attained within 28 (unadjuvanted) or 56 (adjuvanted) days post-vaccination. Peak anti-F protein IgG antibody levels rose 3.6- to 5.6-fold, with an adjuvant effect observed at the 60Â Î¼g dose, and a dose-effect observed between the unadjuvanted 60 and 90Â Î¼g regimens. The anti-F response persisted through 12Â months post-vaccination. Palivizumab-competitive antibodies were below quantifiable levels (<33Â Î¼g/mL) at day 0. The rise of antibodies with specificity for Site II peptide, and the palivizumab-competitive binding activity, denoting antibodies binding at, or in proximity to, antigenic Site II on the F protein, closely paralleled the anti-F response. However, a larger proportion of antibodies in adjuvanted vaccine recipients bound to the Site II peptide at high avidity. Day 0 neutralizing antibodies were high in all subjects and rose 1.3- to 1.7-fold in response to vaccination. Importantly, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with TIV did not impact the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not impact the immune response to the RSV F vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccine induced increases in measures of functional immunity to RSV in older adults and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Adjuvanted formulations provided additional immunogenicity benefit as compared to increasing antigen dose alone.

METHODS: Three hundred thirty women (18-35 years) were randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of RSV F vaccine (60 or 90 Âµg) with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant, or placebo at days 0 and 28. Safety was evaluated over 180 days; immunogenicity and RSV infection rates were evaluated over 112 days. RESULTS: All vaccine formulations were well tolerated, without vaccine-related serious adverse events. Anti-F immunoglobulin G antibodies rose 6.5-15.6-fold, with significantly higher levels in 2-dose, adjuvanted regimens at day 56.

The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60-75 years. METHODS: We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intra-muscular (IM) injection (nâ€¯=â€¯6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart (nâ€¯=â€¯6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (nâ€¯=â€¯6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (nâ€¯=â€¯6), or no vaccine (nâ€¯=â€¯6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV- and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFNÎ³-producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4+/CD8+/Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay). RESULTS: The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4+/CD8+ IFNÎ³-producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFNÎ³-producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody.

However, despite its importance, no vaccine exists. The chimpanzee adenovirus, PanAd3-RSV, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-RSV, are replication-defective viral vectors encoding the RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), and matrix (M2-1) proteins for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. We performed an open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy adults in which four different combinations of prime/boost vaccinations were investigated for safety and immunogenicity, including both intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) administration of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine. The vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the most common reported adverse events being mild injection site reactions. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. RSV neutralizing antibody titers rose in response to IM prime with PanAd3-RSV and after IM boost for individuals primed by the IN route. Circulating anti-F immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were observed after the IM prime and IM boost. RSV-specific T cell responses were increased after the IM PanAd3-RSV prime and were most efficiently boosted by IM MVA-RSV.

Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that provides RSV prophylaxis but requires 5 monthly injections and is approved only for infants who experience the greatest morbidity and mortality from RSV. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for prevention of RSV disease in healthy infants. MEDI8897 is a recombinant human RSV monoclonal antibody with a modified Fc region that extends its half-life and is being developed as RSV prophylaxis for all infants.

Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody to the RSV fusion protein that has an extended half-life. The efficacy and safety of nirsevimab in healthy late-preterm and term infants are uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, infants who had been born at a gestational age of at least 35 weeks to receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo before the start of an RSV season. The primary efficacy end point was medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. The secondary efficacy end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. RESULTS: A total of 1490 infants underwent randomization: 994 were assigned to the nirsevimab group and 496 to the placebo group. Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 12 infants (1.2%) in the nirsevimab group and in 25 infants (5.0%) in the placebo group; these findings correspond to an efficacy of 74.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6 to 87.1; P<0.001) for nirsevimab. Hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 6 infants (0.6%) in the nirsevimab group and in 8 infants (1.6%) in the placebo group (efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, -8.6 to 86.8; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07).

Safety and humoral immune responses were assessed. An extension phase also assessed a RSVPreF3 120 Î¼g vaccination 12-18 months post-first vaccination. RESULTS: The safety profile of RSVPreF3 was unaffected by dose or dTpa co-administration. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were evenly distributed across study groups. Injection-site pain was higher following the second vaccination vs the first vaccination. Medically attended AEs were rare (<5% overall).

We evaluated efficacy and safety of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose and of 2 RSVPreF3 OA doses given 1 year apart against RSV-LRTD over 2 RSV seasons post-dose 1. METHODS: In this phase 3, blinded trial, â‰¥60-year-olds were randomized (1:1) to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo pre-season 1. RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomized (1:1) to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV_revaccination group) or placebo (RSV_1dose group) pre-season 2; participants who received placebo pre-season 1 received placebo pre-season 2 (placebo group). Efficacy of both vaccine regimens against RSV-LRTD was evaluated over 2 seasons combined (confirmatory secondary objective, success criterion: lower limits of 2-sided confidence intervals [CIs] around efficacy estimates >20%). RESULTS: The efficacy analysis comprised 24,967 participants (RSV_1dose: 6227, RSV_revaccination: 6242, placebo: 12,498). Median efficacy follow-up was 17.8 months. Efficacy over 2 seasons of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose was 67.2% (97.5% CI: 48.2-80.0) against RSV-LRTD and 78.8% (95% CI: 52.6-92.0) against severe RSV-LRTD.

A.; Weidenthaler, H.; Stroukova, D.; Martin, B. K.; De Moerlooze, L.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant disease burden in older adults. MVA-BN-RSV is a novel poxvirus-vectored vaccine encoding internal and external RSV proteins. METHODS: In a phase 2a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy participants aged 18 to 50 years received MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, then were challenged 4 weeks later with RSV-A Memphis 37b. Viral load was assessed from nasal washes. RSV symptoms were collected. Antibody titers and cellular markers were assessed before and after vaccination and challenge. RESULTS: After receiving MVA-BN-RSV or placebo, 31 and 32 participants, respectively, were challenged. Viral load areas under the curve from nasal washes were lower (P = .017) for MVA-BN-RSV (median = 0.00) than placebo (median = 49.05). Total symptom scores also were lower (median = 2.50 and 27.00, respectively; P = .004). Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed or culture-confirmed infection was 79.3% to 88.5% (P = .022 and .013). Serum immunoglobulin A and G titers increased approximately 4-fold after MVA-BN-RSV vaccination. Interferon-Î³-producing cells increased 4- to 6-fold after MVA-BN-RSV in response to stimulation with the encoded RSV internal antigens. Injection site pain occurred more frequently with MVA-BN-RSV. No serious adverse events were attributed to vaccination.

Protective immunity is not generated after repeated infections, but vaccination may hopefully prove effective. METHODS: This phase 2 clinical study investigated a multivalent RSV vaccine (MVA-BN-RSV) designed to induce broad antibody and cellular immune responses by encoding RSV surface proteins F, G (for both A and B subtypes), and internal antigens (M2, N). This study evaluated the immune response in adults aged â‰¥55 years to identify the optimal MVA-BN-RSV dose and vaccination schedule. RESULTS: A single dose increased the levels of neutralizing (plaque reduction neutralization test to RSV A and B) and total (IgG and IgA ELISA) antibodies (1.6 to 3.4-fold increase from baseline) and induced a broad Th1-biased cellular immune response (interferon-Î³ ELISPOT) to all 5 vaccine inserts (5.4 to 9.7-fold increases). Antibody responses remained above baseline for 6 months. A 12-month booster dose elicited a booster effect in antibody and T-cell responses (up to 2.8-fold from preboost levels). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: MVA-BN-RSV induces a broad immune response that persists at least 6 months and can be boosted at 12 months, without significant safety findings.

The two primary efficacy end points were medically attended severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants within 90, 120, 150, and 180 days after birth. A lower boundary of the confidence interval for vaccine efficacy (99.5% confidence interval [CI] at 90 days; 97.58% CI at later intervals) greater than 20% was considered to meet the success criterion for vaccine efficacy with respect to the primary end points. RESULTS: At this prespecified interim analysis, the success criterion for vaccine efficacy was met with respect to one primary end point. Overall, 3682 maternal participants received vaccine and 3676 received placebo; 3570 and 3558 infants, respectively, were evaluated.

RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L contains 2 attenuating elements: (1) deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and (2) deletion of codon 1313 of the RSV polymerase gene and the stabilizing missense mutation I1314L. This live vaccine candidate was temperature-sensitive, genetically stable, replication restricted, and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine-placebo ratio, 2:1) at 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive children and at 105 and 106 PFU in 21 and 30 RSV-seronegative children, respectively. RESULTS: In RSV-seronegative children, the 105 PFU dose was overattenuated, but the 106 PFU dose was well tolerated, infectious (RSV/Î”NS2/Î”1313/I1314L replication detected in 90% of vaccinees), and immunogenic (geometric mean serum RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer, 1:64). After the RSV season, 9 of 20 vaccinees had increases in the RSV titer that were significantly greater than those in 8 of 10 placebo recipients (1:955 vs 1:69, respectively), indicating that the vaccine primed for anamnestic responses after natural RSV exposure.

METHODS: Two live attenuated, recombinantly derived RSV vaccine candidates, rA2cp248/404 Delta SH and rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH, were evaluated in 31 adults and in 95 children >/=6 months old. rA2cp248/404/1030 Delta SH was subsequently evaluated in 44 infants 1-2 months old. These vaccine candidates share 4 attenuating genetic elements and differ only in a missense mutation (1030) in the polymerase gene. RESULTS: Both vaccines were highly attenuated in adults and RSV-seropositive children and were well tolerated and immunogenic in RSV-seronegative children.

An investigational vaccine using an engineered recombinant RSV fusion glycoprotein in its post-fusion conformation (RSV F subunit vaccine) has been developed to protect young infants via maternal immunization. This first-in-human, phase I, observer-blind study (NCT02298179) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different dosages and formulations of RSV F subunit vaccine in healthy non-pregnant women and men aged 18-45â€¯years. METHODS: Participants were enrolled (1:1:1) in a stepwise dosage-escalation manner into three cohorts to receive RSV F subunit vaccine containing 45â€¯Âµg, 90â€¯Âµg and 135â€¯Î¼g of RSV F glycoprotein. Within each cohort, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive two doses of RSV F subunit vaccine with (aluminum hydroxide or MF59) or without adjuvant, or placebo, â‰¥28â€¯days apart. Safety (until day 365 post-dose 2), anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and serum total binding antibodies to RSV F protein (until day 181 post-dose 1) were evaluated. RESULTS: All formulations were well-tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. All participants were seropositive for anti-RSV NAbs at baseline, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging from 184 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 127-266) to 380 (95% CI: 272-531). At 28â€¯days post-dose 1, anti-RSV NAb GMTs in vaccine recipients ranged from 893 (95% CI: 702-1,136) to 1,602 (95% CI: 1,243-2,064). No booster effect was observed, but immune responses were maintained above pre-vaccination levels for six months post-dose 1. Ratios of RSV F total binding antibodies fold changes to NAb fold changes ranged from 2.79 to 4.12 at 28â€¯days post-dose 1. The impact of the adjuvant was limited.

CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04657198; EudraCT, 2020-000692-21.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious seasonal virus causing respiratory tract infections. In older adults, RSV can cause serious respiratory illnesses or worsen underlying medical conditions such as chronic diseases of the lungs or heart failure. Severe disease may lead to hospitalization, increased need for oxygen, and ventilatory support. However, several vaccines against RSV in older adults have recently been licensed in the United States and European Union. This study evaluated safety and immune responses after revaccination (third dose) with an adjuvanted vaccine against RSV in older adults aged 60â€“80 years, who had received 2 doses of the vaccine with a similar adjuvanted formulation in a previous (parent) study. Revaccination was done with the licensed vaccine formulation, which was also selected for further investigation in several phase 3 clinical trials. This study found that immune responses against RSV persisted above prevaccination levels for at least 18 months after the second vaccination in the parent study. The third vaccine dose was well tolerated and recalled the immune responses in older adults. Together with the ongoing confirmatory clinical trials, these results help better characterize this RSV vaccine, in terms of safety and RSV-specific immune responses elicited in older adults.eng",2024,Feb-14,J Infect Dis,229,2,355-366,37699064,10.1093/infdis/jiad321,,#692,Leroux-Roels 2024,,GSK; NCT number; Possible RCT; formulation taken forward to phase 3; immunogenicity; older adults; product taken forward to phase 3; protein subunit

F.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the dominant cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, with the most severe cases concentrated among younger infants. METHODS: Healthy pregnant women, at 28 weeks 0 days through 36 weeks 0 days of gestation, with an expected delivery date near the start of the RSV season, were randomly assigned in an overall ratio of approximately 2:1 to receive a single intramuscular dose of RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine or placebo. Infants were followed for 180 days to assess outcomes related to lower respiratory tract infection and for 364 days to assess safety. The primary end point was RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection up to 90 days of life, and the primary analysis of vaccine efficacy against the primary end point was performed in the per-protocol population of infants (prespecified criterion for success, lower bound of the 97.52% confidence interval [CI] of â‰¥30%). RESULTS: A total of 4636 women underwent randomization, and there were 4579 live births. During the first 90 days of life, the percentage of infants with RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection was 1.5% in the vaccine group and 2.4% in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 39.4%; 97.52% CI, -1.0 to 63.7; 95% CI, 5.3 to 61.2). The corresponding percentages for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with severe hypoxemia were 0.5% and 1.0% (vaccine efficacy, 48.3%; 95% CI, -8.2 to 75.3), and the percentages for hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection were 2.1% and 3.7% (vaccine efficacy, 44.4%; 95% CI, 19.6 to 61.5). Local injection-site reactions among the women were more common with vaccine than with placebo (40.7% vs. 9.9%), but the percentages of participants who had other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccination in pregnant women did not meet the prespecified success criterion for efficacy against RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to 90 days of life.

F.; Eickhoff, M.; Esser, M. T.; Tang, R. S.; Dubovsky, F.","Despite substantial morbidity associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, there is no licensed vaccine. MEDI-559 is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine candidate being developed for prevention of lower respiratory illness due to RSV in young children. This randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated safety of MEDI-559 in healthy, RSV-seronegative children. MEDI-559 or placebo was administered on 3 occasions, 2 months apart. Primary safety was based on solicited symptoms (SSs) and adverse events (AEs) collected for 28 days after each dose. Nasal wash samples were collected 3 times after each dose (days 7-10, 12-18, 28-34) and at sick visits. Serum was collected for measuring antibody immune responses to RSV prior to first vaccination and 28 days post final dose. Long-term safety was monitored for 365 days from first dose. SSs were mild and frequent (MEDI-559 84%; placebo 91%); most common SSs were runny/stuffy nose, cough, and irritability/fussiness. AEs occurred in 67% MEDI-559 and 57% placebo recipients: most common AE was upper respiratory tract infection (MEDI-559 35%; placebo 23%). Higher incidence of medically attended lower respiratory illness within 28 days after dosing occurred in the MEDI-559 arm compared to placebo (none associated with vaccine virus shedding). There was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease. Vaccine virus was detected only in MEDI-559 recipients; shedding occurred in 56%subjects, primarily post dose 1. A functional immune response was observed in 59% and 9% MEDI-559 and placebo recipients, respectively, by an RSV microneutralization assay. Vaccine take, assessed by proportion that shed vaccine-type virus or had a seroresponse against RSV, was seen in 95% MEDI-559 subjects. MEDI-559 is therefore biologically active and immunogenic in this seronegative pediatric population. Although the frequency of SSs and AEs was not considered clinically significant, the increase in medically attended lower respiratory illnesses in the vaccine group warrants expanded safety studies.

Eight of 19 vaccinees versus 2 of 9 placebo recipients had substantially increased RSV antibody titers after the RSV season without medically attended RSV disease, indicating anamnestic vaccine responses to wild-type RSV without significant illness. CONCLUSION: LIDÎ”M2-2 had excellent infectivity and immunogenicity, encouraging further study of vaccine candidates attenuated by M2-2 deletion.

Attenuated respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in asthmatic children,"McIntosh, K.; Arbeter, A. M.; Stahl, M. K.; Orr, I. A.; Hodes, D. S.; Ellis, E. F.","Extract: Two live â€œattenuatedâ€ respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines were administered intranasally and by aerosol in placebo-controlled trials among asthmatic children hospitalized at National Jewish Hospital and Research Center (NJH). The first vaccine, a 26Â° -adapted RSV vaccine, was given to 28 children, and a placebo control was given to 25. Twenty-one of 28 vaccinees (75%) had â€œtakes,â€ as judged by virus shedding and/or rises in serum antibody and/or rises in nasal secretion neutralizing activity. No excess in wheezing was attributable to the vaccine administration, although there was a high background level of acute respiratory symptoms in both vaccinees and control subjects. In an outbreak of natural RSV infection which occurred some months after the vaccine was given, there was some evidence that those who received the vaccine less than 4 months before exposure to wild virus were protected against reinfection. Protection was not evident when this interval was greater than 4 months. The second vaccine, a temperature-sensitive mutant strain (ts-1), was administered to 22 children, and placebo to 21. Thirteen children (59%) had â€œtakes.â€ In vaccinees under 6 years of age, 7 of 7 had â€œtakes.â€ Again, no excess wheezing was seen in vaccinees as compared with control subjects, although there was some evidence that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in younger vaccinees. Four of 10 vaccinees shed virus with temperature-sensitive characteristics somewhat different from those of the vaccine strain. Vaccine virus was demonstrated to spread to uninoculated or placebo control children. Natural RSV challenge did not occur during the period of study. Speculation: One of two live â€œattenuatedâ€ RSV vaccines may have produced a brief period of protection against natural infection. This finding offers hope that such live vaccines might prevent disease in selected children over a critical time period, such as infants for the 1st year of life, or allergic or asthmatic children during periods of epidemic prevalence. Asthmatic children did not appear to develop symptoms of wheezing after attenuated RSV infection. This finding suggests that the mechanism of wheezing in asthmatic children with RSV infection may be dependent on, among other factors, the virulence of the virus strain (perhaps its capacity to replicate in and, possibly, invade the lower respiratory tract), rather than on an allergic response to antigens introduced into, and limited to, the upper airway. In view of the spread of the ts-1 vaccine and its apparent loss of temperature sensitivity in some vaccinees, the vaccine may have had the potential for reversion to virulence and hence initiation of epidemic disease. These characteristics are undesirable in live respiratory virus vaccines and should, if possible, be avoided in the development of future such vaccines.",1974,Jul,Pediatr Res,8,7,689-96,4601222,10.1203/00006450-197407000-00001,,#797,McIntosh 1974,,NIAID; No NCT number; Possible RCT; immunogenicity; infants/children; live attenuated/chimeric vaccine; vaccine

In August 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for infants aged <8 months to protect against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection during their first RSV season and for children aged 8-19 months at increased risk for severe RSV disease. In phase 3 clinical trials, nirsevimab efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection with hospitalization was 81% (95% CI = 62%-90%) through 150 days after receipt; post-introduction effectiveness has not been assessed in the United States. In this analysis, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network evaluated nirsevimab effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization among infants in their first RSV season during October 1, 2023-February 29, 2024. Among 699 infants hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 59 (8%) received nirsevimab â‰¥7 days before symptom onset. Nirsevimab effectiveness was 90% (95% CI = 75%-96%) against RSV-associated hospitalization with a median time from receipt to symptom onset of 45 days (IQR = 19-76 days). The number of infants who received nirsevimab was too low to stratify by duration from receipt; however, nirsevimab effectiveness is expected to decrease with increasing time after receipt because of antibody decay. Although nirsevimab uptake and the interval from receipt of nirsevimab were limited in this analysis, this early estimate supports the current nirsevimab recommendation for the prevention of severe RSV disease in infants.

A single dose of the prefusion-stabilized fusion (F) glycoprotein subunit vaccine (DS-Cav1) substantially increases serum-neutralizing activity in healthy adults. We sought to determine whether DS-Cav1 vaccination induces a repertoire mirroring the pre-existing diversity from natural infection or whether antibody lineages targeting specific epitopes predominate. We evaluated RSV F-specific B cell responses before and after vaccination in six participants using complementary B cell sequencing methodologies and identified 555 clonal lineages. DS-Cav1-induced lineages recognized the prefusion conformation of F (pre-F) and were genetically diverse. Expressed antibodies recognized all six antigenic sites on the pre-F trimer. We identified 34 public clonotypes, and structural analysis of two antibodies from a predominant clonotype revealed a common mode of recognition. Thus, vaccination with DS-Cav1 generates a diverse polyclonal response targeting the antigenic sites on pre-F, supporting the development and advanced testing of pre-F-based vaccines against RSV.",2021,Apr-13,Immunity,54,4,769-780.e6,33823129,10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.004,,#866,Mukhamedova 2021,,NIH/NIAID/VRC; No NCT number; Not RCT; adults; immunogenicity; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine

RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated; no meaningful differences in pregnancy or infant outcomes were observed between study groups. RSV-specific antibody levels increased significantly among vaccine recipients, including responses competitive with well-described monoclonal antibodies specific for multiple RSV neutralizing epitopes. No significant antibody increase was seen among placebo recipients, although a shallow upward trend across the RSV season was noted.

Dissociation between serum neutralizing and glycoprotein antibody responses of infants and children who received inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine,"Murphy, B. R.; Prince, G. A.; Walsh, E. E.; Kim, H. W.; Parrott, R. H.; Hemming, V. G.; Rodriguez, W. J.; Chanock, R. M.","The serum antibody response of infants and children immunized with Formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine 20 years ago was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for the RSV fusion (F) and large (G) glycoproteins and a neutralization assay. Twenty-one young infants (2 to 6 months of age) developed a high titer of antibodies to the F glycoprotein but had a poor response to the G glycoprotein. Fifteen older individuals (7 to 40 months of age) developed titers of F and G antibodies comparable to those in children who were infected with RSV. However, both immunized infants and children developed a lower level of neutralizing antibodies than did individuals of comparable age with natural RSV infections. Thus, the treatment of RSV with Formalin appears to have altered the epitopes of the F or G glycoproteins or both that stimulate neutralizing antibodies, with the result that the immune response consisted largely of ""nonfunctional"" (i.e., nonneutralizing) antibodies. Subsequent natural infection of the vaccinees with wild-type RSV resulted in enhanced pulmonary disease. Despite this potentiation of illness, the infected vaccinees developed relatively poor G, F, and neutralizing antibody responses. Any or all of three factors may have contributed to the enhancement of disease in the RSV-infected vaccinees. First, nonfunctional antibodies induced by the inactivated RSV vaccine may have participated in a pulmonary Arthus reaction during RSV infection. Second, the poor antibody response of infants to the G glycoprotein present in the Formalin-inactivated vaccine may have been inadequate to provide effective resistance to subsequent wild-type virus infection. Third, the relatively reduced neutralizing antibody response of the infant vaccinees to wild-type RSV infection may have contributed to their enhanced disease by delaying the clearance of virus from their lungs.",1986,Aug,J Clin Microbiol,24,2,197-202,3755730,10.1128/jcm.24.2.197-202.1986,,#875,Murphy 1986,,No NCT number; Not RCT; formalin inactivated; immunogenicity; infants/children; vaccine
Formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine induces antibodies to the fusion glycoprotein that are deficient in fusion-inhibiting activity,"Murphy, B. R.; Walsh, E. E.","The fusion (F) glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces neutralizing antibodies and antibodies that inhibit fusion of infected cells (FI antibody). It was previously shown that infants and children immunized with Formalin-inactivated RSV 20 years ago developed antibodies that bound to the F glycoprotein but were deficient in neutralizing activity. A reexamination of these sera indicated that they were also deficient in FI activity. Thus, Formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine stimulated an unbalanced immune response in which an unusually large proportion of the induced antibodies were directed against nonprotective epitopes rather than against the epitopes that induce functional antibodies, i.e., neutralizing and FI antibodies. This deficiency in stimulation of functional antibodies probably decreased the protective efficacy of the vaccine and could have contributed to potentiation of disease in the vaccines during subsequent RSV infection.",1988,Aug,J Clin Microbiol,26,8,1595-7,2459154,10.1128/jcm.26.8.1595-1597.1988,,#876,Murphy 1988,,No NCT number; Not RCT; formalin inactivated; immunogenicity; infants/children; vaccine

Even though currently there are no approved hRSV vaccines for newborns or infants, several candidates are being developed. rBCG-N-hRSV is a vaccine candidate previously shown to be safe in a phase I clinical trial in adults (clinicaltrials.gov identifier #NCT03213405). Here, secondary immunogenicity analyses were performed on these samples. METHODS: PBMCs isolated from immunized volunteers were stimulated with hRSV or mycobacterial antigens to evaluate cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-derived molecules and the expansion of memory T cell subsets. Complement C1q binding and IgG subclass composition of serum antibodies were assessed. RESULTS: Compared to levels detected prior to vaccination, perforin-, granzyme B-, and IFN-Î³-producing PBMCs responding to stimulus increased after immunization, along with their effector memory response. N-hRSV- and mycobacterial-specific antibodies from rBCG-N-hRSV-immunized subjects bound C1q. CONCLUSION: Immunization with rBCG-N-hRSV induces cellular and humoral immune responses, supporting that rBCG-N-hRSV is immunogenic and safe in healthy individuals.

There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection. METHODS: In an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01(E)-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to show vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI], 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 62.4 to 99.9) against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (assessed on the basis of clinical signs or by the investigator) and 71.7% (95% CI, 56.2 to 82.3) against RSV-related acute respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy was similar against the RSV A and B subtypes (for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease: 84.6% and 80.9%, respectively; for RSV-related acute respiratory infection: 71.9% and 70.6%, respectively). High vaccine efficacy was observed in various age groups and in participants with coexisting conditions. The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but most adverse events for which reports were solicited were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. The incidences of serious adverse events and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and prevented RSV-related acute respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract disease and severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age or older, regardless of RSV subtype and the presence of underlying coexisting conditions.

Vaccine reactions were monitored, and bloods were obtained before vaccination, 4 weeks after vaccination, and at the end of the RSV season. Respiratory illnesses were evaluated during the outbreak. Neutralizing antibody (Nt Ab) assay to RSV, IgG ELISA to RSV proteins and a Western blot assay were performed. Acute reactions with the PFP vaccine were mild. An early RSV outbreak resulted in infection of 44.4% of the TIV recipients shortly after vaccination. In the PFP vaccine groups, the Nt Ab and ELISA assays did not distinguish between Ab rises due to natural infection versus vaccine; however, the Western blot assay characterized the post-vaccine rises. Two major Western blot profiles were produced: an infection profile (antibodies that recognized the F and G surface glycoproteins and internal proteins) and a vaccine profile (antibodies that recognized only the surface glycoproteins). The PFP vaccinees who were not infected with RSV developed ELISA and Nt Ab responses to the surface glycoproteins that were similar to the TIV vaccines with natural RSV infection. None of the children developed vaccine-enhanced disease. Thus, the PFP-1 vaccine was safe and immunogenic in RSV seropositive children even when vaccine was administered during a RSV outbreak, and the Western blot assay was useful in distinguishing Ab rises caused by RSV infection versus PFP vaccine.",1995,Aug,Vaccine,13,12,1095-101,7491817,10.1016/0264-410x(95)00034-x,,#972,Piedra 1995,,Lederle Praxis Biologicals; No NCT number; Possible RCT; efficacy/effectiveness; immunogenicity; infants/children; protein based particle/subunit vaccine; vaccine

W.","OBJECTIVE: To test in a double blind, placebo-controlled study a purified fusion protein (PFP-2) vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in RSV-seropositive children with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Seventeen CF children, mean age 4.5 years, received PFP-2 vaccine and 17 CF children, mean age 5.8 years, received a saline vaccine. At enrollment the Shwachman clinical score, Brasfield radiographic score, oxygen saturation (SpO2), anthropometric indices and other variables were recorded. After vaccination the reactions were assessed daily for 7 days. During the RSV season weekly telephone interviews were performed and children with an acute respiratory illness were evaluated and cultured for RSV. Serum was drawn before vaccination, 1 month after vaccination and at the end of the RSV season and tested for antibodies to RSV. RESULTS: Other than age the baseline measurements at enrollment were similar between groups. The PFP-2 vaccine produced mild local reactions and induced a significant neutralizing antibody response in two-thirds of the vaccinees and a significant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-fusion glycoprotein antibody response in nearly all the PFP-2 vaccinees. Vaccine-enhanced disease was not observed in PFP-2 vaccines infected with RSV.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and immunogenicity of yearly sequential administration of the PFP-2 vaccine in CF children. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-nine of the 34 CF children who participated in the previous study were enrolled in this open label vaccine study. All of the CF children ages 2.6 to 8.9 years received the PFP-2 vaccine, the PFP/PFP group received the PFP-2 vaccine in 1993 and 1994 and the saline/PFP group received the vaccine for the first time in 1994.

A.","The immunogenicity and pathogenicity of a strain of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus modified by sequential induction of three temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations have been evaluated by intranasal administration to 22 adult volunteers. This modified virus, a triple ts mutant designated ts1C, was derived from a double mutant ts1B evaluated in a previous trial. The original isolate (strain RSS-2) and all its derivatives were propagated throughout in human diploid cells in a specially assigned laboratory. The triple mutant ts1C is unable to multiply in MRC-5 cells at 37 degrees C and above. Following nasal administration of ts1C, immune responses were observed in volunteers with low pre-existing neutralizing antibody titres. The ability of mutant ts1C to induce upper respiratory tract disease in adults was greatly diminished in comparison with the non-ts wild-type virus, but not markedly more so than a previously tested double ts mutant (ts1B) which replicates at 37 degrees C.

R.; Chen, G.; Graham, B. S.","BACKGROUND: Multiple active vaccination approaches have proven ineffective in reducing the substantial morbidity and mortality caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and older adults (aged â‰¥65 years). A vaccine conferring a substantial and sustainable boost in neutralising activity is required to protect against severe RSV disease. To that end, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of DS-Cav1, a prefusion F subunit vaccine. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial, the stabilised prefusion F vaccine DS-Cav1 was evaluated for dose, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy adults aged 18-50 years at a single US site. Participants were assigned to receive escalating doses of either 50 Î¼g, 150 Î¼g, or 500 Î¼g DS-Cav1 at weeks 0 and 12, and were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio within each dose group to receive the vaccine with or without aluminium hydroxide (AlOH) adjuvant. After 71 participants had been randomised, the protocol was amended to allow some participants to receive a single vaccination at week 0. The primary objectives evaluated the safety and tolerability at every dose within 28 days following each injection. Neutralising activity and RSV F-binding antibodies were evaluated from week 0 to week 44 as secondary and exploratory objectives. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose; secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analysis included all participants with available data at a given visit. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049488, and is complete and no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Feb 21, 2017, and Nov 29, 2018, 244 participants were screened for eligibility and 95 were enrolled to receive DS-Cav1 at the 50 Î¼g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH), 150 Î¼g (n=35, of which n=15 with AlOH), or 500 Î¼g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH) doses. DS-Cav1 was safe and well tolerated and no serious vaccine-associated adverse events deemed related to the vaccine were identified. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited robust neutralising activity and binding antibodies by 4 weeks after a single vaccination (p<0Â·0001 for F-binding and neutralising antibodies). In analyses of exploratory endpoints at week 44, pre-F-binding IgG and neutralising activity were significantly increased compared with baseline in all groups. At week 44, RSV A neutralising activity was 3Â·1 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·8 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·5 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). RSV B neutralising activity was 2Â·8 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·4 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 3Â·7 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Pre-F-binding IgG remained significantly 3Â·2 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 3Â·4 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·0 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Pre-F-binding serum IgA remained 4Â·1 fold above baseline in the 50 Î¼g group, 4Â·3 fold in the 150 Î¼g group, and 4Â·8 fold in the 500 Î¼g group (p<0Â·0001). Although a higher vaccine dose or second immunisation elicited a transient advantage compared with lower doses or a single immunisation, neither significantly impacted long-term neutralisation. There was no long-term effect of dose, number of vaccinations, or adjuvant on neutralising activity. INTERPRETATION: In this phase 1 study, DS-Cav1 vaccination was safe and well tolerated. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited a robust boost in RSV F-specific antibodies and neutralising activity that was sustained above baseline for at least 44 weeks. A single low-dose of pre-F immunisation of antigen-experienced individuals might confer protection that extends throughout an entire RSV season.

In addition, we assessed immunogenicity and safety. RESULTS: After participants were inoculated with the challenge virus, vaccine efficacy of 86.7% (95% CI, 53.8 to 96.5) was observed for symptomatic RSV infection confirmed by any detectable viral RNA on at least 2 consecutive days. The median AUC for the RSV viral load (hoursâ€‰Ã—â€‰log(10) copies per milliliter) as measured by RT-qPCR assay was 0.0 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 19.0) in the vaccine group and 96.7 (interquartile range, 0.0 to 675.3) in the placebo group. The geometric mean factor increase from baseline in RSV A-neutralizing titers 28 days after injection was 20.5 (95% CI, 16.6 to 25.3) in the vaccine group and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3) in the placebo group. More local injection-site pain was noted in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were observed in either group.

METHODS: This phase 1, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1345 in adults 65-79 years (NCT04528719). Participants were randomized to receive 1-dose of mRNA-1345 (12.5, 25, 50, 100, or 200-Âµg) or placebo and matched mRNA-1345 booster or placebo at 12-months. RESULTS: Overall, 298 participants received the first injection; 247 received the 12-month booster injection. mRNA-1345 was generally well-tolerated after both injections, with the most frequently reported solicited adverse reactions being injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, arthralgia, and myalgia. Reactogenicity was higher after the booster injection than the first injection but similar severity, time-to-onset, and duration. A single mRNA-1345 injection boosted RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing antibody titers (nAb) and prefusion-F-binding antibody (preF-bAb) concentrations at 1-month (geometric mean-fold rises: RSV-A, 10.2-16.5; RSV-B, 5.3-12.5; preF-bAb, 7.2-12.1). RSV antibody levels remained above baseline through 12-months, indicating immune persistence. A 12-month booster injection also increased RSV-A and RSV-B nAb titers and preF-bAb concentrations; titers post-booster injection were numerically lower compared to titers after the first-dose, with overlapping 95% CIs.

The efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine in pregnant women and their infants are uncertain. METHODS: In a phase 2b trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women, at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation, to receive either 120 or 240 Î¼g of RSVpreF vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. The trial included safety end points and immunogenicity end points that, in this interim analysis, included 50% titers of RSV A, B, and combined A/B neutralizing antibodies in maternal serum at delivery and in umbilical-cord blood, as well as maternal-to-infant transplacental transfer ratios. RESULTS: This planned interim analysis included 406 women and 403 infants; 327 women (80.5%) received RSVpreF vaccine. Most postvaccination reactions were mild to moderate; the incidence of local reactions was higher among women who received RSVpreF vaccine containing aluminum hydroxide than among those who received RSVpreF vaccine without aluminum hydroxide. The incidences of adverse events in the women and infants were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups; the type and frequency of these events were consistent with the background incidences among pregnant women and infants. The geometric mean ratios of 50% neutralizing titers between the infants of vaccine recipients and those of placebo recipients ranged from 9.7 to 11.7 among those with RSV A neutralizing antibodies and from 13.6 to 16.8 among those with RSV B neutralizing antibodies. Transplacental neutralizing antibody transfer ratios ranged from 1.41 to 2.10 and were higher with nonaluminum formulations than with aluminum formulations.

A pediatric vaccine against RSV would not only prevent morbidity and mortality amongst infants and young children but could also reduce transmission to elderly. The RSVÎ”G vaccine consists of a live-attenuated RSV that lacks the G attachment protein. RSVÎ”G is severely impaired in binding to host cells and exhibits reduced infectivity in preclinical studies. Intranasal immunization of cotton rats with RSVÎ”G vaccine protected against replication of wildtype RSV, without inducing enhanced disease. METHODS: We performed a first-in-human trial with primary objective to evaluate safety and shedding of RSVÎ”G (6.5 log(10) CCID(50)) after intranasal administration. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 50, with RSV neutralizing serum titers below 9.6 log(2), received a single dose of either vaccine or placebo (nÂ =Â 48, ratio 3:1). In addition to safety and tolerability, nasal viral load, and systemic and humoral immune responses were assessed at selected time points until 4Â weeks after immunization. RESULTS: Intranasal administration of RSVÎ”G was well tolerated with no findings of clinical concern. No infectious virus was detected in nasal wash samples. Similar to other live-attenuated RSV vaccines, neutralizing antibody response following inoculation was limited in seropositive adults. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 6.5 log(10) CCID(50) of RSVÎ”G was safe and well-tolerated in seropositive healthy adults.

METHODS: Healthy adults were randomized to receive both initial vaccination and revaccination 12 months later with either placebo or RSVpreF 240 Âµg (Â±Al(OH)3). RSV-A and RSV-B geometric mean neutralizing titers (GMTs) were measured through 12 months after both vaccinations. Tolerability/safety was assessed. RESULTS: There were 263 participants revaccinated (18-49-years-old, n=134; 65-85-years-old, n=129). Among 18-49-year-olds and 65-85-year-olds, respectively, geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) for both RSV subgroups (RSV-A; RSV-B) 1 month after initial RSVpreF vaccination were 13.3-20.4 and 8.9-15.5 compared with levels before initial vaccination; corresponding GMFRs 12 months after initial vaccination were 4.1-5.0 and 2.6-4.1. GMFRs 1 month after revaccination compared with levels before revaccination were 1.4-2.3 and 1.4-2.2 for 18-49-year-olds and 65-85-year-olds, respectively. Peak GMTs after revaccination were lower than those after initial vaccination. GMTs 12 months after initial vaccination and revaccination were similar, with GMFRs ranging from 0.7-1.6. No safety signals occurred. CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF revaccination was immunogenic and well-tolerated among adults.

C.; Schmoele-Thoma, B.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes considerable illness in older adults. The efficacy and safety of an investigational bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine in this population are unknown. METHODS: In this ongoing, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults (â‰¥60 years of age) to receive a single intramuscular injection of RSVpreF vaccine at a dose of 120 Î¼g (RSV subgroups A and B, 60 Î¼g each) or placebo. The two primary end points were vaccine efficacy against seasonal RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two or at least three signs or symptoms. The secondary end point was vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated acute respiratory illness. RESULTS: At the interim analysis (data-cutoff date, July 14, 2022), 34,284 participants had received RSVpreF vaccine (17,215 participants) or placebo (17,069 participants). RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms occurred in 11 participants in the vaccine group (1.19 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 33 participants in the placebo group (3.58 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 66.7%; 96.66% confidence interval [CI], 28.8 to 85.8); 2 cases (0.22 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 14 cases (1.52 cases per 1000 person-years of observation), respectively, occurred with at least three signs or symptoms (vaccine efficacy, 85.7%; 96.66% CI, 32.0 to 98.7). RSV-associated acute respiratory illness occurred in 22 participants in the vaccine group (2.38 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 58 participants in the placebo group (6.30 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, 37.1 to 77.9). The incidence of local reactions was higher with vaccine (12%) than with placebo (7%); the incidences of systemic events were similar (27% and 26%, respectively). Similar rates of adverse events through 1 month after injection were reported (vaccine, 9.0%; placebo, 8.5%), with 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, considered by the investigators to be injection-related. Severe or life-threatening adverse events were reported in 0.5% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were reported in 2.3% of participants in each group through the data-cutoff date. CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF vaccine prevented RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness in adults (â‰¥60 years of age), without evident safety concerns.

Determinants of susceptibility to challenge and the antibody response of adult volunteers given experimental respiratory syncytial virus vaccines,"Watt, P. J.; Robinson, B. S.; Pringle, C. R.; Tyrrell, D. A.",The virulence and immunogenicity of a wild-type respiratory syncytial (RS) virus together with four temperature sensitive (ts) mutants derived from this isolate were tested by intranasal inoculation into adult volunteers. Resistance to challenge correlated with neutralizing antibody titres in nasal secretions and to a lesser extent in serum. All ts mutants were reduced in virulence.

M.; Scheys, I.; De Paepe, E.; Comeaux, C. A.; Ligtenberg, N.; Callendret, B.; Heijnen, E.","BACKGROUND: Since influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) carry significant burden in older adults with overlapping seasonality, vaccines for both pathogens would ideally be coadministered in this population.

METHODS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to the Coadministration or Control group. The Coadministration group received concomitant Ad26.RSV.preF/RSV preF protein and Fluzone-HDÂ® on Day 1 and placebo on Day 29, while the Control group received Fluzone-HDÂ® and placebo at Day 1 and Ad26.RSV.preF/RSV preF protein on Day 29. Influenza hemagglutination-inhibiting and RSV preF-binding antibody titers were measured postvaccination and tested for noninferiority between both groups. Safety data were collected throughout the study and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Coadministered Ad26.RSV.preF/RSV preF protein and Fluzone-HDÂ® vaccines induced noninferior immune responses compared to each vaccine administered alone. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates against influenza were similar between groups. Both vaccines remained well tolerated upon concomitant administration.

T.","Nirsevimab is an extended half-life monoclonal antibody specific for the prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein, which has been studied in preterm and full-term infants in the phase 2b and phase 3 MELODY trials. We analyzed serum samples collected from 2,143 infants during these studies to characterize baseline levels of RSV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), duration of RSV NAb levels following nirsevimab administration, the risk of RSV exposure during the first year of life and the infant's adaptive immune response to RSV following nirsevimab administration. Baseline RSV antibody levels varied widely; consistent with reports that maternal antibodies are transferred late in the third trimester, preterm infants had lower baseline RSV antibody levels than full-term infants. Nirsevimab recipients had RSV NAb levels >140-fold higher than baseline at day 31 and remained >50-fold higher at day 151 and >7-fold higher at day 361. Similar seroresponse rates to the postfusion form of RSV F protein in nirsevimab recipients (68-69%) compared with placebo recipients (63-70%; not statistically significant) suggest that while nirsevimab protects from RSV disease, it still allows an active immune response.

METHODS: This phase 1 clinical trial was performed in healthy adults agedâ€…â‰¥60 years. Seventy-two participants received 1 or 2 intramuscular injections of low-dose (LD; 5 Ã— 1010 vector particles) or high-dose (HD; 1 Ã— 1011 vector particles) Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine or placebo, with approximately 12 months between doses and 2-year follow-up for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were reported by 44% of vaccine recipients and were transient and mild or moderate in intensity. No serious adverse events were related to vaccination.

L.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults. An mRNA-based RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, encoding the stabilized RSV prefusion F glycoprotein, is under clinical investigation. METHODS: In this ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2-3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive one dose of mRNA-1345 (50 Î¼g) or placebo. The two primary efficacy end points were the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and with at least three signs or symptoms. A key secondary efficacy end point was the prevention of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 35,541 participants were assigned to receive the mRNA-1345 vaccine (17,793 participants) or placebo (17,748). The median follow-up was 112 days (range, 1 to 379). The primary analyses were conducted when at least 50% of the anticipated cases of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease had occurred. Vaccine efficacy was 83.7% (95.88% confidence interval [CI], 66.0 to 92.2) against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with at least two signs or symptoms and 82.4% (96.36% CI, 34.8 to 95.3) against the disease with at least three signs or symptoms. Vaccine efficacy was 68.4% (95% CI, 50.9 to 79.7) against RSV-associated acute respiratory disease. Protection was observed against both RSV subtypes (A and B) and was generally consistent across subgroups defined according to age and coexisting conditions. Participants in the mRNA-1345 group had a higher incidence than those in the placebo group of solicited local adverse reactions (58.7% vs. 16.2%) and of systemic adverse reactions (47.7% vs. 32.9%); most reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. Serious adverse events occurred in 2.8% of the participants in each trial group. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of the mRNA-1345 vaccine resulted in no evident safety concerns and led to a lower incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease than placebo among adults 60 years of age or older.

R.","BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is targeted for vaccine development, because it causes severe respiratory tract illness in the elderly, young children, and infants. A primary strategy has been to derive live attenuated viruses for use in intranasally administered vaccines that will induce a protective immune response. In the present study, the NS2 gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes the host's interferon- alpha / beta response, was deleted from RSV vaccine candidates by use of reverse genetics. METHODS: Three NS2 gene-deleted RSV vaccine candidates were studied: rA2cp Delta NS2, rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2, and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2. rA2cp Delta NS2, which had the fewest attenuating mutations, was evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive children. rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2 were evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive and RSV-seronegative children. RESULTS: At a high dose (10(7.0) pfu), rA2cp Delta NS2 was not shed by adults, and only 13% of them had an immune response. The other vaccine candidates, rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 and rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2, had greatly decreased infectivity in RSV-seronegative children, compared with that of their immediate parent strains, which possess an intact NS2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of the NS2 gene attenuates RSV in subjects of all ages studied. This validates the strategy of developing live respiratory tract virus vaccines in which the virus's ability to inhibit the human innate immune system is blocked. rA2cp248/404 Delta NS2 should be studied in children at a higher input titer, because it was more infectious and immunogenic than was rA2cp530/1009 Delta NS2.",2006,Feb-15,J Infect Dis,193,4,573-81,16425137,10.1086/499600,,#1397,Wright 2006,,NIH/Wyeth Vaccines; No NCT number; Not RCT; adults; immunogenicity; infants/children; live attenuated/chimeric vaccine; vaccine
